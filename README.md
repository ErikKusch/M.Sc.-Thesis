# M.Sc.Thesis

DESCRIPTION:
Masters Thesis with the University of Bergen concerning vegetation memory effects and possible ties to plant functional trait expressions.

SUPERVISORS:
1. Alistair Seddon (Alistair.Seddon@uib.no)
2. Richard Davy (Richard.Davy@nersc.no)

PROJECT OUTLINE:
1. Preparing NDVI and Era5 data
2. Identifying vegetation memory effects using Principal Component Regression within each study region
3. Retrieve plant functional trait (PFT) data, and Life History Trait (LHT) data
4. Retrieve plant species distribution data for the different study regions according to ecoregions
5. Combine species dsitribution maps and plant functional trait data
6. Link vegetation memory effects with PFT and LHT patterns within each study region
