abstract = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as the AUC, is currently considered to be the standard method to assess the accuracy of predictive distribution models. It avoids the supposed subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability derived scores are converted to a binary presence–absence variable, by summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

abstract = {The idea that there is an identifiable set of boundaries, beyond which anthropogenic change will put the Earth system outside a safe operating space for humanity, is attracting interest in the scientific community and gaining support in the environmental policy world. Rockstrom et al. (2009) identify nine such boundaries and highlight biodiversity loss as being the single boundary where current rates of extinction put the Earth system furthest outside the safe operating space. Here we review the evidence to support a boundary based on extinction rates and identify weaknesses with this metric and its bearing on humanity's needs. While changes to biodiversity are of undisputed importance, we show that both extinction rate and species richness are weak metrics for this purpose, and they do not scale well from local to regional or global levels. We develop alternative approaches to determine biodiversity loss boundaries and extend our analysis to consider large-scale responses in the Earth system that could affect its suitability for complex human societies which in turn are mediated by the biosphere. We suggest three facets of biodiversity on which a boundary could be based: the genetic library of life; functional type diversity; and biome condition and extent. For each of these we explore the science needed to indicate how it might be measured and how changes would affect human societies. In addition to these three facets, we show how biodiversity's role in supporting a safe operating space for humanity may lie primarily in its interactions with other boundaries, suggesting an immediate area of focus for scientists and policymakers.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that maximum latewood density (MXD) should be used instead of tree-ring width (TRW) data to reconstruct post-volcanic cooling effects. A thorough assessment of high frequency signals and potentially differing memory effects in long MXD and TRW chronologies, in response to large volcanic eruptions, is still missing, however. We here present a compilation of MXD and TRW chronologies from 11 sites in the Northern Hemisphere, covering the past 750+ years, and containing significant June-August temperature signals. Basic assessment of the data using Superposed Epoch Analysis reveals a temporally extended response in TRW, by 2-3 years, to large volcanic eruptions, though post-volcanic cooling patterns vary considerably within the Northern Hemisphere network. Comparison with instrumental temperature data demonstrates the TRW chronologies underestimate cold conditions associated with large volcanic eruptions, a bias that is mitigated in the MXD data. While species composition (pine, spruce, larch) has no detectable influence on the cooling patterns, trees from high latitude sites ({\textgreater}60°N) indicate a stronger and delayed (1-2 years) response to large eruptions, compared to the lower latitude sites ({\textless}60°N). These basic findings caution against using TRW data for quantitatively estimating post-volcanic cooling and for comparison against the simulated climate effects of volcanic eruptions in models.},

Complex systems thinking has inspired both theory and applied strategies for improving ecosystem resilience and adaptability, but applications in forest ecology and management are just beginning to emerge. We review the properties of complex systems using four well-studied forest biomes (temperate, boreal, tropical and Mediterranean) as examples. The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses.We show how this approach can help forest scientists and managers to conceptualize forests as integrated social-ecological systems and provide concrete examples of how to manage forests as complex adaptive systems.},

abstract = {Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

abstract = {Final ecosystemservices (i.e. services that directly benefit humanity) depend fundamentally upon the various processes, regulated by organisms, which underpin ecosystem functioning and maintain ecosystem structures. Such processes include inter alia primary productivity, detritus decomposition, pollination, soil formation, and nutrient uptake and fixation. Insights into the abiotic, biotic, and spatial factors regulating these "supporting ecosystem processes" have arisen from within multiple fields of ecology which have not always been well integrated, including research on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) and biodiversity-ecosystem service (B-ES) relationships, meta-ecosystem ecology, and ecological resilience. Here, we draw together insights from these fields towards a framework suitable for addressing impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem processes and the services they support. We further discuss application of portfolio theory and a trait-based framework as unifying approaches in the assessment and management of ecosystem functioning and services, and identify a set of "resilience attributes" useful for assessing the resilience of ecosystem structure, functioning, and service delivery. Finally, we discuss future research challenges and opportunities, including uncertainties involved in linking species traits and interactions with ecosystem functioning and services. We conclude that the necessary theory and tools are already in place to begin the unification of B-EF, B-ES, meta-ecosystem, and resilience frameworks and to test their application in the assessment and management of ecosystem services. ?? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article proposes a simple new logic for classifying global vegetation. The critical features of this classification are that 1) it is based on simple, observable, unambiguous characteristics of vegetation structure that are important to ecosystem biogeochemistry and can be measured in the field for validation, 2) the structural characteristics are remotely sensible so that repeatable and efficient global reclassifications of existing vegetation will be possible, and 3) the defined vegetation classes directly translate into the biophysical parameters of interest by global climate and biogeochemical models. A first test of this logic for the continental United States is presented based on an existing 1 km AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index database. Procedures for solving critical remote sensing problems needed to implement the classification are discussed. Also, some inferences from this classification to advanced vegetation biophysical variables such as specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity useful to global biogeochemical modeling are suggested. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

abstract = {Landscapes are strongly shaped by the degree of interaction between pattern and process. This paper examines how ecological memory, the degree to which an ecological process is shaped by its past modifications of a landscape, influences landscape dynamics. I use a simulation model to examine how ecological memory shapes the landscape dynamics produced by the interaction of vegetative regrowth and fire. The model illustrated that increased ecological memory increased the strength and spatial extent of landscape pattern. The extent of these changes depended upon the relative rates of vegetative recovery and fire initiation. When ecological memory is strong, landscape pattern is persistent; pattern tends to be maintained rather than destroyed by fire. The generality of the simulation model suggests that these results may also apply to disturbance processes other than fire. The existence of ecological memory in ecosystems may allow processes to produce ecological pattern that can entrain other ecosystem variables. The methods presented in this paper to analyze pattern in model ecosystems could be used to detect such pattern in actual ecosystems.},

abstract = {Models predicting ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2 ) exchange under future climate change rely on relatively few real-world tests of their assumptions and outputs. Here we demonstrate a rapid and cost-effective method to estimate CO2 exchange from intact vegetation patches under varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) in a boreal forest rose linearly by 4.7 ± 0.2{\%} of the current ambient rate for every 10 ppm CO2 increase, with no detectable influence of foliar biomass, season or nitrogen (N) fertilization. The lack of any clear short-term NEE response to fertilization in such an N-limited system is inconsistent with the instantaneous down-regulation of photosynthesis formalized in many global models. Incorporating an alternative mechanism with considerable empirical support - diversion of excess carbon to storage compounds - into an existing earth system model brings the model output into closer agreement with our field measurements. A global simulation incorporating this modified model reduces a long-standing mismatch between the modeled and observed seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 . Wider application of this chamber approach would provide critical data needed to further improve modeled projections of biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange in a changing climate.

Simple axiomatic approaches were used to generate the prior land cover map, in which pixels with high consistency were regarded to be correct and then used as benchmark to obtain posterior land cover map. Validation results show that our hybrid land cover map (synGLC, the dataset is available on request) has the best overall performance compared with the existing global land cover products. Closed shrub-lands and permanent wetlands have the highest uncertainty in our fused land cover map. This novel method can be extensively applied to fusion of land cover maps with different legends, spatial resolutions or geographic ranges.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim In recent decades species ranges have shifted upwards in elevation and north- wards in latitude. These shifts are commonly interpreted as a response to recent climate warming. However, several alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain the elevational shifts, including increased deposition of atmospheric nitro- gen, changes in precipitation and dispersal limitation.We evaluate these hypotheses and attempt to identify the dominant drivers for the observed shifts in the upper range limits of alpine plant species. Location European mountains from Svalbard to the southern Alps. Methods We assembled data on observed shifts in the upper range limit of alpine plants over 40 to 100 years on 114 mountains. We related the observed shifts to recent changes in temperature and precipitation and to recent deposition of atmos- pheric nitrogen. Changes in traits and habitat preferences of species in the summit assemblages were used to evaluate the potential role of different drivers. Results Seventy per cent of the species that showed a detectable change in their upper range limits between surveys shifted their range limits upwards. The same species tend to move up on different mountains. There are, however, large differ- ences between mountains in the proportion of species shifting upwards. This proportion is not found to be statistically related to local changes in temperature. Correspondingly, warmth-demanding species did not move upward more fre- quently than expected by chance. Snow-bed species have become more commonon summits. Main conclusions Our data do not support the idea that climate warming is the dominant factor causing the observed range shifts of alpine plant species on Euro- pean mountains: first, the amount of change in species assemblages on the summits studied is not related statistically to the amount of climate warming; second, those species that have moved upwards are not particularly warmth demanding},

abstract = {Increasingly, the success of management interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation are viewed as being dependent on the 'resilience' of the system. Although the term 'resilience' is increasingly used by policy makers and environmental managers, the concept of 'resilience' remains vague, varied and difficult to quantify. Here we clarify what this concept means from an ecological perspective, and how it can be measured and applied to ecosystem management. We argue that thresholds of disturbance are central to measuring resilience. Thresholds are important because they offer a means to quantify how much disturbance an ecosystem can absorb before switching to another state, and so indicate whether intervention might be necessary to promote the recovery of the pre-disturbance state. We distinguish between helpful resilience, where resilience helps recovery, and unhelpful resilience where it does not, signalling the presence of a threshold and the need for intervention. Data to determine thresholds are not always available and so we consider the potential for indices of functional diversity to act as proxy measures of resilience. We also consider the contributions of connectivity and scale to resilience and how to incorporate these factors into management. We argue that linking thresholds to functional diversity indices may improve our ability to predict the resilience of ecosystems to future, potentially novel, disturbances according to their spatial and temporal scales of influence. Throughout, we provide guidance for the application of the resilience concept to ecosystem management. In doing so, we confirm its usefulness for improving biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper integrates perspectives from meteorologists, climatologists, statisticians and hydrologists, to identify generic end user (in particular impact modeler) needs, and to discuss downscaling capabilities and gaps. End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities, temporal and spatial variability, as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscaling, we review perfect prog statistical downscaling, model output statistics and weather generators, focussing on recent developments to improve the representation of space time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, sub-daily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in smallscale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model.},

abstract = {Occasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that such shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states. Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

abstract = {Significant and growing concerns relating to global social and environmental conditions and processes have raised deep questions relating to the ability of traditional governance regimes to manage for the complexities of social-ecological systems. The resilience framework provides a more dynamic approach to system analysis and management, emphasizing nonlinearity, feedbacks, and multiscalar engagement along the social-ecological nexus. In recent years, however, a number of scholars and practitioners have noted various insufficiencies in the formulation of the resilience framework, including its lack of engagement with the dimensions of power within social-ecological systems, which blunt the analytical potential of resilience and run the risk of undermining resilience- based management objectives. In this analysis, we engage with this power problematic by drawing on key insights from the scholarly tradition of political ecology, suggesting that a more appreciative, thoroughgoing engagement between resilience scholarship and political ecology may allow not only a deeper treatment of power within the resilience framework but also address several important critiques of political ecology itself. We explore the shared intellectual spaces of these traditions and suggest some ways in which a critical engagement between resilience and political ecology on the subject of power better informs our understanding of socio-political dynamics within complex systems. In closing, we train the critical light backward on political ecology to suggest that an appreciative engagement with the resilience framework may assist by reasserting a more serious treatment of ecology within political ecological analyses and support the formulation of more elegant, politically tractable counternarratives to address global environmental crises.},

By translating simulated climate variables and actual vegetation boundaries into maps of biomes, these models explicitly link the vegetation and climate patterns together, enabling the determination of trajectories of climate change. Through this research, a new one million scale biome map of India is prepared, based on actual vegetation cover type map derived from wide field sensor onboard Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS WiFS-spatial resolution 200 m) and Holdridge life zone (HLZ) system. A biome level characterization (BLC) model has been developed wherein, temporal satellite data helps to define the phenologically discriminant vegetation cover type, climatic parameters viz., biotemperature, mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ratio have been used to identify potential life zones and finally describe the biome boundaries based on the vegetation cover type and life zones. The study identifies 35 cover classes and describes 17 vegetation cover types. This is close to the type description given by Champion and Seth [Champion, H.G., Seth, S.K., 1968. A Revised Survey of Forest Types of India. New Delhi Government Publication, New Delhi.] in their forest cover type map.

We evaluate the literature on biome shifts in plants in relation to a set of hypotheses on the size, connectedness, and absolute age of biomes, as well as on the adaptability of particular lineages and ecological interactions over time. We also critique the phylogenetic inference of past biomes and a “global” model-based approach to biome evolution.

We show that these traits are approximately distributed proportional to leaf area instead of mass, as expected for a light- and carbon dioxide-collecting organ. Much of the structure in the mass-normalized LES results from normalizing area-proportional traits by mass. Mass normalization induces strong correlations among area-proportional traits because of large variation among species in leaf mass per area (LMA). The high LMA variance likely reflects its functional relationship with leaf life span. A LES that is independent of mass- or area-normalization and LMA reveals physiological relationships that are inconsistent with those in global vegetation models designed to address climate change.},

There are a few approaches to modelling long-term vegetation dynamics; their principles are discussed in brief. A model approach based on bioclimatic schemes has been chosen for further considerations. A model based on Holdridge's bioclimatic scheme was designed for simulation of time-dependent biome shifts. A procedure of time delays was designed to take into account inertia of vegetation response to climate change. It was based on expert estimates of biome replacements. Computer experiments have been designed to investigate the consequences of time-dependent climate changes for the vegetation of Russia. The results showed the importance of the temporal factor for long-term forecasts. The obtained assessments demonstrated complex non-linear dynamics of vegetation even under the simplest climatic scenario. Further prospects of suggested model were discussed.},

abstract = {Vegetation indices play an important role in monitoring variations in vegetation. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) proposed by the MODIS Land Discipline Group and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are both global-based vegetation indices aimed at providing consistent spatial and temporal information regarding global vegetation. However, many environmental factors such as atmospheric conditions and soil background may produce errors in these indices. The topographic effect is another very important factor, especially when the indices are used in areas of rough terrain. In this paper, we theoretically analyzed differences in the topographic effect on the EVI and the NDVI based on a non-Lambertian model and two airborne-based images acquired from a mountainous area covered by high-density Japanese cypress plantation were used as a case study. The results indicate that the soil adjustment factor “L” in the EVI makes it more sensitive to topographic conditions than is the NDVI. Based on these results, we strongly recommend that the topographic effect should be removed in the reflectance data before the EVI was calculated—as well as from other vegetation indices that similarly include a term without a band ratio format (e.g., the PVI and SAVI)—when these indices are used in the area of rough terrain, where the topographic effect on the vegetation indices having only a band ratio format (e.g., the NDVI) can usually be ignored.},

We combined three existing global land cover maps (MOD12, GLC2000, and UMD) based on the principle that the majority view pre-vails and validated the resulting map by using information collected as part of the Degree Confluence Project (DCP). We used field survey information gathered by DCP volunteers from 4211 worldwide locations to validate the new land cover map, as well as the three existing land cover maps that were combined to create it. Agreement between the DCP-derived information and the land cover maps was 61.3{\%} for our new land cover map, 60.3{\%} for MOD12, 58.9{\%} for GLC2000, and 55.2{\%} for UMD. Although some of the improve-ments we achieved were not statistically significant, this project has shown that an improved land cover map can be developed and well-validated globally using our method.},

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory.

abstract = {Evidence of abrupt changes in ecosystem states, such as sudden eutrophication in lakes, has been increasingly reported in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial systems. Ecosystems may have more than one state with a self-stabilizing mechanism, so that a shift between states does not occur frequently and is not readily reversible. These big changes are termed regime shifts where often one state is preferred over another. Thus, regime shifts are problematic for ecosystem managers, and the need exists for studies that lead to the identification of thresholds of key variables that trigger regime shifts. Regime shifts are currently difficult to predict and in many cases may be caused by the human pursuit of efficiency in land and water productivity in the last few decades. Here I briefly introduce a theoretical approach to predict the shift between a clear-water state and a turbid state in lakes, the best-studied example of regime shifts. This paper also discusses alternative states in other natural systems besides ecosystems to draw more attention to the research currently being performed on regime shifts.},

abstract = {Single image super-resolution is the task of inferring a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution input. Traditionally, the performance of algorithms for this task is measured using pixel-wise reconstruction measures such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which have been shown to correlate poorly with the human perception of image quality. As a result, algorithms minimizing these metrics tend to produce over-smoothed images that lack high-frequency textures and do not look natural despite yielding high PSNR values. We propose a novel application of automated texture synthesis in combination with a perceptual loss focusing on creating realistic textures rather than optimizing for a pixel-accurate reproduction of ground truth images during training. By using feed-forward fully convolutional neural networks in an adversarial training setting, we achieve a significant boost in image quality at high magnification ratios. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets show the effectiveness of our approach, yielding state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.},

abstract = {Within the context of climate change, it is of utmost importance to quantify the stability of ecosystems with respect to climate anomalies. It is well acknowledged that ecosystem stability may change over time. As these temporal stability changes may provide a warning for increased vulnerability of the system, this study provides a methodology to quantify and assess these temporal changes in vegetation stability. Within this framework, vegetation stability changes were quantified over Australia from 1982 to 2006 using GIMMS NDVI and climate time series (i.e., SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index)). Starting from a stability assessment on the complete time series, we aim to assess: (i) the magnitude and direction of stability changes; and (ii) the similarity in these changes for different stability metrics, i.e., the standard deviation of the NDVI anomaly (SD), auto-correlation at lag one of the NDVI anomaly (AC) and the correlation of NDVI anomaly with SPEI (CS). Results show high variability in magnitude and direction for the different stability metrics. Large areas and types of Australian vegetation showed an increase in variability (SD) over time; however, vegetation memory (AC) decreased. The association of NDVI anomalies with drought events (CS) showed a mixed response: the association increased in the western part, while it decreased in the eastern part. This methodology shows the potential for quantifying vegetation responses to major climate shifts and land use change, but results could be enhanced with higher resolution time series data.},

Lakes represent excellent model case studies in this respect and have been used widely to demonstrate theories of ecological stability and resilience that are needed to underpin preventative management approaches. However, we argue that this approach is not yet fully developed because the pursuit of empirical evidence to underpin such theoretically grounded management continues in the absence of an objective probability framework. This has blurred the lines between intuitive logic (based on the elementary principles of probability) and extensional logic (based on assumption and belief) in this field.

The training areas are derived automatically from the geographical information system (GIS) database. After an introduction into the general approach, different input channels for the classification are defined and discussed. The results of a test on two test areas are presented.

@article{Crisp2006,
abstract = {THE FOLLOWING IS THE FULL TEXT OF THE ARTICLE Increasing attention is being focused on biomes, their evolution and assembly (Pennington et al., 2004). Biomes are broad biogeographical regions defined by climate, vegetation structure and ecophysiology. Narrowly, a 'biome' is a recognizable area of endemism containing a 'biota'. In one viewpoint, biomes are analogous to organismal lineages, responding as a whole to events in earth history and, in the extreme view, classifiable like organisms. Thus a biota that was widespread in the Mesozoic of Gondwana might have fragmented and differentiated into new biomes by vicariance as the supercontinent split apart. A contrasting view is that biomes have accreted stochastically from individual taxa, each on its own trajectory through time and space. In this view, biome composition is dynamic because taxa respond differently to environmental changes (by adaptation, radiation and extinction) and opportunities to migrate to new areas. A biome might contain any combination of both kinds of elements. For two decades, the first scenario has been the province of cladistic biogeography; the second of ecological biogeography. Nevertheless, a phylogenetic framework is needed to test hypotheses about events occurring over macroevolutionary time, irrespective of whether the events were driven by vicariance or ecological factors. To differentiate between these scenarios, comparative studies are needed using representative samples of taxa in biomes. Such studies are few (e.g. Sanmart{\'{i}}n {\&} Ronquist, 2004), and even fewer have employed molecular dating to test the predicted timing of divergences (Givnish {\&} Renner, 2004; Pennington et al., 2004). Specific questions relevant to biome assembly are: (1) what is the geographical pattern of sister taxa among biomes? (2) is there a prediction of congruent pattern resulting from historical events (such as vicariance or opening of a migration corridor)? (3) if migration is inferred, what was its direction between biomes? and (4) did the timing of divergence events coincide in taxa for which congruence is inferred? These questions require inference of the ancestral area of the most recent common ancestor of sister taxa in different biomes. The direction of migration is important because only migrations into a biome are relevant to its assembly. Also, knowledge of the sources of immigrating taxa is needed to test whether the biome evolved as a unit. No historical biogeographical method adequately infers ancestral areas or direction of migration. If the area occupied by an ancestor were known, then the direction of dispersal (if any) into the areas occupied by its descendants could be deduced. Cladistic biogeography implicitly ignores dispersal and infers ancestral areas by assuming ancestral cosmopolitanism. Other methods use variants of parsimony or maximum likelihood to infer ancestral areas from extant areas analogously to inferring ancestral traits. For example, a standard parsimony approach reasons that, if a taxon restricted to area A is nested within a paraphyletic group of taxa that are all restricted to area B, then B is inferred as ancestral followed by migration from B to A. Although this method is widely used, it has several problems. Numerous taxa are known as fossils in areas where they are no longer extant (Hill, 2004), but current methods model extant distributions only, excluding a priori the possibility of an ancestral range outside the extant range. Also, the analogy between areas and traits is not strictly applicable, because area 'inheritance' depends on the mode of speciation (Cook {\&} Crisp, 2005). Third, the method fails to take account of processes that could have caused multiple dispersals in the opposite direction (from A to B), such as prevailing wind and ocean currents, leading to a paraphyletic area B (Cook {\&} Crisp, 2005). A congruent pattern of sister-group relationships between taxa in different biomes might be predicted if these biota share a common geographical history (such as vicariance or mass migration). This suggests a null hypothesis that taxa have independent patterns in time and space. In contrast, cladistic biogeography operates under a null hypothesis of congruence because it assumes vicariance is the dominant process. However, vicariance should not be assumed as additional processes, such as immigration and extinction, are known to influence organismal distributions. Therefore congruence is a hypothesis that requires testing against a null hypothesis of independence among taxa. Congruence due to a common environmental cause is testable by dating divergences between lineages. For example, Poux et al. (2005) asked whether the sister-group relationships between Africa and Madagascar in four mammalian lineages could be explained by Gondwanan vicariance ({\textgreater} 84 Ma) or a land bridge (45–26 Ma). Using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with several fossils, they rejected Gondwanan vicariance in all four cases: the oldest 95{\%} confidence limit for any divergence (between Malagascy lemurs and Lorisiformes) was 69.6 Ma. Although the land bridge could not be rejected because all four sets of confidence limits overlapped the hypothesized period, synchrony of the four divergences was rejected. In a recent issue of this journal, Galley {\&} Linder (2006) took a similar approach to the history of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). This is a mega-diverse biome, one of seven floral kingdoms in the world. Its huge diversity is concentrated into a small area, yet 70{\%} of species are endemic despite a broad land link to the rest of Africa. Ecologically and floristically, it is sharply distinguished from adjacent biomes. Galley {\&} Linder compared 13 dated phylogenies representing the dominant components of the heathy fynbos vegetation that characterizes the CFR (e.g. Erica, Proteaceae, Bruniaceae, Restionaceae and Phylica). CFR taxa have sister groups in Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand and South America (the so-called Gondwanan track), tropical Africa and Europe. Galley {\&} Linder (2006) asked whether these links are ancient and vicariant or the results of more recent migration. They also asked whether the divergences between CFR taxa and those elsewhere were consistent with a common driving event such as vicariance or concerted dispersal. Galley {\&} Linder found no congruent pattern of area relationships. Many more temperate taxa had links to Australasia than to South America, which they reported as surprising because the south Atlantic is narrower (6000 km) than the Indian Ocean (8000 km). However, Galley {\&} Linder did not consider West Wind Drift, which would favour dispersal across the southern Indian Ocean over that across the South Atlantic because West Wind Drift is stronger in the former. The divergence times found by Galley {\&} Linder appeared too young to support a hypothesis of Gondwanan vicariance. The southern Indian Ocean probably opened between 120 and 100 Ma, earlier than any of the mean divergence times found in their study. Even the possibility that the Kerguelen Plateau provided a stepping stone between CFR and Australia until c. 90 Ma could account for the divergence in only four dated divergences between CFR and Australasia. Similarly, the single dated CFR–South American divergence appeared too young to be the result of the opening of the South Atlantic c. 120 Ma. However, in the absence of confidence limits on some of these estimates, Gondwanan vicariance cannot yet be completely ruled out. Using the parsimony criterion, only four of the phylogenies examined by Galley {\&} Linder indicated a directionality of migration between CFR and other areas. Two were inferred to have come from Australia (Ehrharta and Restionaceae); one from elsewhere in Africa (Danthonioideae); and one from other sources in the southern Hemisphere (Iridaceae, in part). On the other hand, migrations of taxa from the CFR to the high mountains of tropical Africa were inferred in eight different taxa, rejecting previous hypotheses of vicariance or migration in the opposite direction. An obvious test of this hypothesis – whether the age of the tropical African mountains is consistent with the timing of the inferred migrations – was not carried out. Overall, the analysis of Galley {\&} Linder (2006) hammers another nail into the coffin of the Gondwanan dogma of a vicariant temperate southern hemisphere flora (McGlone, 2005). Their study provides strong evidence that the CFR has not evolved as a single biotic unit through space and time. Rather, it seems to have been assembled stochastically over a prolonged period (at least the last 90 Myr) with different lineages immigrating from (or emigrating to) external areas in several directions. Similar results have been found by other comparative studies (Givnish {\&} Renner, 2004; Sanmart{\'{i}}n {\&} Ronquist, 2004; Poux et al., 2005). Further evidence against the unitary view of biomes is provided by 'no-analogue' palaeocommunities (Ackerly, 2003; Hill, 2004), which are thought to have combined environmental parameters and taxa that do not co-occur today. Environmental tracking by taxa that once co-existed in these communities has apparently led to their descendants occupying different areas, and thus the biomes themselves have changed. Application of ecological principles to historical biogeography has a controversial past, but there is an increasing view that reintegration of ecology and biogeography is necessary for the latter to progress (Ackerly, 2003; Cook {\&} Crisp, 2005; Riddle, 2005).},

abstract = {(i) Anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, are causing nonlinear changes in ecosystems globally. The development of reliable early warning indicators (EWIs) to predict these changes is vital for the adaptive management of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, natural capital and ecosystem services. Increased variance and autocorrelation are potential early warning indicators and can be readily estimated from ecological time series. Here, we undertook a comprehensive test of the consistency between early warning indicators and nonlinear abundance change across species, trophic levels and ecosystem types. We tested whether long-term abundance time series of 55 taxa (126 data sets) across multiple trophic levels in marine and freshwater ecosystems showed (i) significant nonlinear change in abundance ‘turning points' and (ii) significant increases in variance and autocorrelation (‘early warning indicators'). For each data set, we then quantified the prevalence of three cases: true positives (early warning indicators and associated turning point), false negatives (turning point but no associated early warning indicators) and false positives (early warning indicators but no turning point). True positives were rare, representing only 9{\%} (16 of 170) of cases using variance, and 13{\%} (19 of 152) of cases using autocorrelation. False positives were more prevalent than false negatives (53{\%} vs. 38{\%} for variance; 47{\%} vs. 40{\%} for autocorrelation). False results were found in every decade and across all trophic levels and ecosystems. Time series that contained true positives were uncommon (8{\%} for variance; 6{\%} for autocorrelation), with all but one time series also containing false classifications. Coherence between the types of early warning indicators was generally low with 43{\%} of time series categorized differently based on variance compared to autocorrelation. Synthesis and applications. Conservation management requires effective early warnings of ecosystem change using readily available data, and variance and autocorrelation in abundance data have been suggested as candidates. However, our study shows that they consistently fail to predict nonlinear change. For early warning indicators to be effective tools for preventative management of ecosystem change, we recommend that multivariate approaches of a suite of potential indicators are adopted, incorporating analyses of anthropogenic drivers and process-based understanding.},

abstract = {Woody vegetation in global tropical drylands is of significant importance for both the interannual variability of the carbon cycle and local livelihoods. Satellite observations over the past decades provide a unique way to assess the vegetation long-term dynamics across biomes worldwide. Yet, the actual changes in the woody vegetation are always hidden by interannual fluctuations of the leaf density, because the most widely used remote sensing data are primarily related to the photosynthetically active vegetation components. Here, we quantify the temporal trends of the nonphotosynthetic woody components (i.e., stems and branches) in global tropical drylands during 2000-2012 using the vegetation optical depth (VOD), retrieved from passive microwave observations. This is achieved by a novel method focusing on the dry season period to minimize the influence of herbaceous vegetation and using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to remove the interannual fluctuations of the woody leaf component. We revealed significant trends (P {\textless} 0.05) in the woody component (VODwood ) in 35{\%} of the areas characterized by a nonsignificant trend in the leaf component (VODleaf modeled from NDVI), indicating pronounced gradual growth/decline in woody vegetation not captured by traditional assessments. The method is validated using a unique record of ground measurements from the semiarid Sahel and shows a strong agreement between changes in VODwood and changes in ground observed woody cover (r(2) = 0.78). Reliability of the obtained woody component trends is also supported by a review of relevant literatures for eight hot spot regions of change. The proposed approach is expected to contribute to an improved assessment of, for example, changes in dryland carbon pools.},

abstract = {To answer many of the major questions in comparative botany, ecology, and global change biology it is necessary to extrapolate across enormous geographic, temporal and taxonomic scales. Yet much ecological knowledge is still based on observations conducted within a local area or even a few hundred square meters. Understanding ecological patterns and how plants respond to global warming and human alteration of landscapes and ecosystems necessitates a holistic approach. Such an approach must be conducted at a scale that is commensurate with the breadth of the questions being asked. Further, it requires identification, retrieval, and integration of diverse data from a global confederation of collaborating scientists across a broad range of disciplines. We propose to network core databases and data networks to create a novel resource for quantitative plant biodiversity science. The grand challenge is to assemble and share the world's rapidly accumulating botanical information from plots and collections to create a distributed, web-accessible, readily analyzable data resource. With such a resource, we will answer major questions of direct relevance to plant ecology, plant evolution, plant geography, conservation, global change biology, and protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In particular, how does climate influence the distribution and abundance of plant species, how does the phylogenetic diversity of plants vary across broad environmental and climatic gradients, and how are plants assembled into ecological communities? While these and associated questions are at the core of many research endeavors in comparative botany and ecology, our past collective inability to integrate data on a large scale has significantly limited our ability to address these questions head on. This proposed Grand Challenge team will create a data resource of unprecedented size and scope together with the tools for its use, thereby empowering botanists and the general public to better address fundamental issues in plant ecology and global change biology. Although we will focus on plants of the New World, the infrastructure and protocols developed will be scalable to all geographic regions and all types of organisms. Future steps will enable cross-cutting linkages to emerging networks on plant genomics, physiology, and phylogeny, allowing us to address fundamental genetic and evolutionary questions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a set of paleoclimate simulations for 21, 16, 14, 11 and 6 ka (thousands of years ago) carried out with the Community Climate Model, Version 1 (CCM1) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This climate model uses four interactive components that were not available in our previous simulations with the NCAR CCM0 (COHMAP, 1988 Science, 241, 1043-1052; Wright et al., 1993 Global Climate Since the Last Glocial Maximum, University of Minnesota Press, MN): soil moisture, snow hydrology, sea-ice, and mixed-layer ocean temperature. The new simulations also use new estimates of ice sheet height and size from Peltier (1994, Science, 265, 195-201), and synchronize the astronomically dated orbital forcing with the ice sheet and atmospheric CO2 levels corrected from radiocarbon years to calendar years. The CCM1 simulations agree with the previous simulations in their most general characteristics. The 21 ka climate is cold and dry, in response to the presence of the ice sheets and lowered CO2 levels. The period 14-6 ka has strengthened northern summer monsoons and warm mid-latitude continental interiors in response to orbital changes. Regional differences between the CCM1 and CCM0 simulations can be traced to the effects of either the new interactive model components or the new boundary conditions. CCM1 simulates climate processes more realistically, but has additional degrees of freedom that can allow the model to 'drift' toward less realistic solutions in some instances. The CCM1 simulations are expressed in terms of equilibrium vegetation using BIOME 1, and indicate large shifts in biomes. Northern tundra and forest biomes are displaced southward at glacial maximum and subtropical deserts contract in the mid-Holocene when monsoons strengthen. These vegetation changes could, if simulated interactively, introduce additional climate feedbacks. The total area of vegetated land remains nearly constant through time because the exposure of continental shelves with lowered sea level largely compensates for the land covered by the expanded ice sheets.},

abstract = {When plants recognize potential opponents, invading pathogens, wound signals, or abiotic stress, they often switch to a primed state of enhanced defense. However, defense priming can also be induced by some natural or synthetic chemicals. In the primed state, plants respond to biotic and abiotic stress with faster and stronger activation of defense, and this is often linked to immunity and abiotic stress tolerance. This review covers recent advances in disclosing molecular mechanisms of priming. These include elevated levels of pattern-recognition receptors and dormant signaling enzymes, transcription factor HsfB1 activity, and alterations in chromatin state. They also comprise the identification of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase as a receptor of the priming activator $\beta$-aminobutyric acid. The article also illustrates the inheritance of priming, exemplifies the role of recently identified priming activators azelaic and pipecolic acid, elaborates on the similarity to defense priming in mammals, and discusses the potential of defense priming in agriculture.},

A new mapping approach for transforming satellite observations acquired by the SPOT4/VGTETATION (VGT) sensor into land cover information is outlined. The procedure includes: (1) conversion of daily data into 10-day composite; (2) post-seasonal correction and refinement of apparent surface reflectance in 10-day composite images; and (3) extraction of land cover information from the composite images. The pre-processing and mosaicking techniques developed and used in this study proved to be very effective in removing cloud contamination, BRDF effects, and noise in Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR). The GLC 2000-NCA land cover map is provided as a regional product with 28 land cover classes based on modified Federal Geographic Data Committee/Vegetation Classification Standard (FGDC NVCS) classification system, and as part of a global product with 22 land cover classes based on Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

abstract = {Memory effects refer to the impacts of antecedent climate conditions on current vegetation productivity. This temporal linkage has been found to be strong in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the dominant climatic factors that determine such patterns are still unclear. Here, we defined'water-memory effects' as the persistent effects of antecedent precipitation on the vegetation productivity for a given memory length (from 1 to up to 12 months). Based on satellite observations and climate data, we quantified the length of water-memory effects and evaluated the contributions of antecedent precipitation on current vegetation. Our results showed that vegetation productivity was highly dependent on antecedent precipitation in arid and semi-arid regions. The average length of water memory was approximately 5.6 months. Globally, water-memory effects could explain the geographical pattern and strength of memory effects, indicating that precipitation might be the dominant climatic factor determining memory effects because of its impact on water availability. Moreover, our results showed vegetation in regions with low mean annual precipitation or a longer water memory has lower engineering resilience (i.e. slower recovery rate) to disturbances. These findings will enable better assessment of memory effects and improve our understanding of the vulnerability of vegetation to climate change.},

These include small scale disturbances like a falling tree, but also large scale disturbances like eutrophication and climate change. Resilience is a useful indicator to assess whether an ecosystem has the capacity to maintain functioning with environmental variability. In this study we tested whether plant functional traits can be distinguished to develop a response-and-effect framework for general predictions concerning resilience. We defined response traits to assess the system's resistance to disturbance, and effect traits to assess its recovery after disturbance. We used a dataset with 932 vegetation plots containing 104 species from a selected wetland area in The Netherlands. The environmental variability was related to response traits and the response traits to effect traits with RLQ analysis, fourth-corner analysis and Spearman's rank correlation. As a result, combinations of traits that specify effects of environmental change on ecosystem resilience were found. A strong resistance to environmental variability was shown, and consequently, a positive effect on resilience. Due to correlations between response and effect traits, combinations of traits were identified having a variable effect on the resilience of the system. In this way this study argues to further develop a response-and-effect framework to understand and assess ecosystem resilience. The selection of traits is system-specific, and therefore, one should only select those response and effect traits that differentiate between response to environmental variability and effects on ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In an effort to develop more holistic ecosystem approaches to resource assessment and management, landscapes need to be stratified into homogeneous geographic regions. These regions can then be used in a monitoring framework to develop reliable estimates of ecosystem productivity. A regional characterization of the woodland biome has been developed for South Africa, delineated by satellite imagery and using environmental data and a rigorous statistical methodology.Distributionmaps of key environmental variables are analyzed by factor analysis, an iterative clustering technique and maximum likelihood classification to quantify and identify homogeneous physio-climatic units. A spatial clustering technique was used to identify regions, which are statistically different with regard to five physiographic, climatic and edaphic variables deemed important within southern African savanna woodlands. The woodland biome of South Africa at 1km resolution was successively divided. Thirty year mean monthly temperature, total plant-available water balance of soil, elevation, landscape topographic position, and landscape soil fertility were used as input classification variables. The map data were submitted to a factor analysis and varimax axis rotation. The factor analysis removes cor- relations from the input variables, reduces the dimensionality, and normalizes the axis measurements. A cluster analysis was performed on the three principal factor scores using a modified iterative optimization clustering procedure to determine the finest level of classes statistically permitable. Twenty-seven identified unimodal cluster signatures were then submitted to a maximum likelihood classification where the statistical probability of the GIS cell assignment is carried out to determine class membership. The final map of custom physio-climatic regions is described, and these custom regions are comparedwith a vegetation potentialmap of the woodland types identified in the South African summer rainfall zone.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that tropical forest and savanna could represent alternative stable states, implying critical transitions at tipping points in response to altered climate or other drivers. So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

abstract = {Aim Our aim was to quantify climatic influences on key leaf traits and relationships at the global scale. This knowledge provides insight into how plants have adapted to different environmental pressures, and will lead to better calibration of future vegetation-climate models. Location The data set represents vegetation from 175 sites around the world. Methods For more than 2500 vascular plant species, we compiled data on leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf life span (LL), nitrogen concentration (N(mass)) and photosynthetic capacity (A(mass)). Site climate was described with several standard indices. Correlation and regression analyses were used for quantifying relationships between single leaf traits and climate. Standardized major axis (SMA) analyses were used for assessing the effect of climate on bivariate relationships between leaf traits. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize multidimensional trait variation. Results At hotter, drier and higher irradiance sites, (1) mean LMA and leaf N per area were higher; (2) average LL was shorter at a given LMA, or the increase in LL was less for a given increase in LMA (LL-LMA relationships became less positive); and (3) A(mass) was lower at a given N(mass), or the increase in A(mass) was less for a given increase in N(mass). Considering all traits simultaneously, 18{\%} of variation along the principal multivariate trait axis was explained by climate. Main conclusions Trait-shifts with climate were of sufficient magnitude to have major implications for plant dry mass and nutrient economics, and represent substantial selective pressures associated with adaptation to different climatic regimes.},

Such maps can result from either compilations of observed spatial patterns or from simulations from models that are global in scope. The method is illustrated by comparing global maps resulting from applying a modified Holdridge Life Zone Classification to current climate and several climate change scenarios (CO2 doubling). These scenarios were based on the results of several different general circulation models (GCMs). The direction of change in simulated vegetation patterns between different GCMs was found to be quite similar for all future projections. Although there were differences in magnitude and extent, all simulations indicate potential for enormous ecological change. The Kappa statistic proved to be a useful and straightforward measure of agreement between the different global vegetation maps. Furthermore, Kappa statistics for individual vegetation zones clearly indicated differences and similarities between those maps. The Kappa statistic was found to be most useful for rank ordering of agreement, both across a series of maps and across the various vegetation zones within a map. ?? 1992.},

Caswell presented an algorithm based on vector calculus that speeds up, and improves the practicality of the application of the sensitivity analysis, by calculating the derivatives of the explicit elements from the population Leslie matrix. Despite the usefulness of the sensitivity analysis, it is still barely applied to empirical data, partially due to requirements of high quality demographic data and failure of compatibility between time intervals of field data collection and organism's life stage timing. This can result in the absence of a certain vital rate as a separated element in the population projection matrix, and thus intricacy in obtaining its sensitivity. In this note we call the attention for the applied value of sensitivity analysis, and also we point to a simple formula that is easily implemented in Caswell Matlab algorithm, to calculate the sensitivity of a vital rate that is not explicit as a matrix element. 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

When applied to the simulation of tree-ring widths from North America and Russia from the Mann et al. (1998) and Vaganov et al.

abstract = {Abstract. Exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reserves of northern West Siberia has promoted rapid industrialization and urban development in the region. This development leaves significant footprints on the sensitive northern environment, which is already stressed by the global warming. This study reports the region-wide changes in the vegetation cover as well as the corresponding changes in and around 28 selected urbanized areas. The study utilizes the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from high-resolution (250m) MODIS data acquired for summer months (June through August) over 15 years (2000{\&}ndash;2014). The results reveal the increase of NDVI (or “greening”) over the northern (tundra and tundra-forest) part of the region. Simultaneously, the southern, forested part shows the widespread decrease of NDVI (or “browning”). These region-wide patterns are, however, highly fragmented. The statistically significant NDVI trends occupy only a small fraction of the region. Urbanization destroys the vegetation cover within the developed areas and at about 5–10km distance around them. The studied urbanized areas have the NDVI values by 15 to 45{\%} lower than the corresponding areas at 20–40km distance. The largest NDVI reduction is typical for the newly developed areas, whereas the older areas show recovery of the vegetation cover. The study reveals a robust indication of the accelerated greening near the older urban areas. Many Siberian cities become greener even against the wider browning trends at their background. Literature discussion suggests that the observed urban greening could be associated not only with special tending of the within-city green areas but also with the urban heat islands and succession of more productive shrub and tree species growing on warmer sandy soils.},

abstract = {Efforts to quantify the composition of biological communities increasingly focus on functional traits. The composition of communities in terms of traits can be summarized in several ways. Ecologists are beginning to map the geographic distribution of trait-based metrics from various sources of data, but the maps have not been tested against independent data. Using data for birds of the Western Hemisphere, we test for the first time the most commonly used method for mapping community trait composition - overlaying range maps, which assumes that the local abundance of a given species is unrelated to the traits in question - and three new methods that as well as the range maps include varying degrees of information about interspecific and geographic variation in abundance. For each method, and for four traits (body mass, generation length, migratory behaviour, diet) we calculated community-weighted mean of trait values, functional richness and functional divergence. The maps based on species ranges and limited abundance data were compared with independent data on community species composition from the American Christmas Bird Count (CBC) scheme coupled with data on traits. The correspondence with observed community composition at the CBC sites was mostly positive (62/73 correlations) but varied widely depending on the metric of community composition and method used (R(2): 5.6 x 10(-7) to 0.82, with a median of 0.12). Importantly, the commonly-used range-overlap method resulted in the best fit (21/22 correlations positive; R(2): 0.004 to 0.8, with a median of 0.33). Given the paucity of data on the local abundance of species, overlaying range maps appears to be the best available method for estimating patterns of community composition, but the poor fit for some metrics suggests that local abundance data are urgently needed to allow more accurate estimates of the composition of communities.},

abstract = {Quantifying environmental controls on vegetation is critical to predict the net effect of climate change on global ecosystems and the subsequent feedback on climate. Following a non-linear Granger causality framework based on a random forest predictive model, we exploit the current wealth of multi-decadal satellite data records to uncover the main drivers of monthly vegetation variability at the global scale. Results indicate that water availability is the most dominant factor driving vegetation globally: about 61{\%} of the vegetated surface was primarily water-limited during 1981–2010. This included semiarid climates but also transitional ecoregions. Intra-annually, temperature controls Northern Hemisphere deciduous forests during the growing season, while antecedent precipitation largely dominates vegetation dynamics during the senescence period. The uncovered dependency of global vegetation on water availability is substantially larger than previously reported. This is owed to the ability of the framework to (1) disentangle the co-linearities between radiation/temperature and precipitation, and (2) quantify non-linear impacts of climate on vegetation. Our results reveal a prolonged effect of precipitation anomalies in dry regions: due to the long memory of soil moisture and the cumulative, non-linear, response of vegetation, water-limited regions show sensitivity to the values of precipitation occurring three months earlier. Meanwhile, the impacts of temperature and radiation anomalies are more immediate and dissipate shortly, pointing to a higher resilience of vegetation to these anomalies. Despite being infrequent by definition, hydro-climatic extremes are responsible for up to 10{\%} of the vegetation variability during the 1981–2010 period in certain areas, particularly in water-limited ecosystems. Our approach is a first step towards a quantitative comparison of the resistance and resilience signature of different ecosystems, and can be used to benchmark Earth system models in their representations of past vegetation sensitivity to changes in climate.},

Species respond to such environmental modifications by adapting to new conditions or by shifting their geographic distributions towards more suitable areas. The latter might be constrained by species' functional traits that influence their ability to move, reproduce or establish. Here, we show that functional traits related to dispersal, reproduction, habitat use and diet have influenced how three pollinator groups (bees, butterflies and hoverflies) responded to changes in climate and land-use in the Netherlands since 1950. Across the three pollinator groups, we found pronounced areal range expansions ({\textgreater}53{\%}) and modelled range shifts towards the north (all taxa: 17–22 km), west (bees: 14 km) and east (butterflies: 11 km). The importance of specific functional traits for explaining distributional changes varied among pollinator groups. Larval diet preferences (i.e. carnivorous vs. herbivorous/detritivorous and nitrogen values of host plants, respectively) were important for hoverflies and butterflies, adult body size for hoverflies, and flight period length for all groups. Moreover, interactions among multiple traits were important to explain species' geographic range shifts, suggesting that taxon-specific multi-trait analyses are needed to predict how global change will affect biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties. Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. This line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. It also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. Updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. This new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species' effects on key ecosystem properties. We hope this new handbook becomes a standard companion in local and global efforts to learn about the responses and impacts of different plant species with respect to environmental changes in the present, past and future.},

abstract = {Temporal autocorrelation in demographic processes is an important aspect of population dynamics, but a comprehensive examination of its effects on different life-history strategies is lacking. We use matrix population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate stochastic population growth rates (log $\lambda$s) under different temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in sensitivities, or changes of log $\lambda$s to changes in autocorrelation among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history strategies.},

abstract = {Forest management faces a substantial challenge with ever-more-pervasive anthropogenic impacts and growing demands on forests coupled with the increasing certainty of global change. If the capacity of forests to provide valued ecological goods and services in the future is to be maintained, new tools and approaches will be needed. Several approaches have been influential in dealing with sustainability challenges in forest management and forestry to date, two of the most notable being the ecosystem approach and adaptive management. Resilience-based approaches have now emerged as a new paradigm to deal with these challenges. This paper considers how resilience thinking might inform forest management by exploring its conceptual basis in comparison with the ecosystem approach and adaptive management as two earlier influences. We identify three novel conceptual contributions and outline some of the key challenges encountered when applying resilience thinking to the management of forests.Resilience thinking offers new conceptual contributions for dealing with large and uncertain changes, the relationships between social and ecological components of forest systems, and a new perspective on sustainability. However, there are several barriers to it informing forest management in a practical way, including means by which resilience can be measured and valued within a management context, and most importantly, how resilience can be maintained and enhanced within systems focused on resource production or service provision. Resilience thinking's contributions are largely conceptual at this stage and offer more in terms a problem-framing approach than analytical or practical tools. Decision-relevant, science-based, and solution-oriented approaches are required to tackle future forest management challenges. Resilience thinking, if developed to become more solution-orientated could offer a needed complement to current management paradigms. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {After the chicken, the House Sparrow is the most widely distributed bird species in the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica and on most human-inhabited islands. Although its Latin name is Passer domesticus, it is certainly not domesticated. In fact, it is widely regarded as a pest species and is consequently not protected in most of its extensive range. This combination of ubiquity and minimal legal protection has contributed to its wide use in studies by avian biologists throughout the world. The purpose of this book is to review and summarize the results of these global studies on House Sparrows, and to provide a springboard for future studies on the species. House Sparrows have been used to study natural selection in introduced species, circadian rhythms, and the neuroendocrine control of the avian annual cycle. One current question of considerable interest concerns the catastrophic House Sparrow population declines in several urban centers in Europe. Is the House Sparrow a contemporary canary in the mine? Other topics of broad interest include the reproductive and flock-foraging strategies of sparrows, and sexual selection and the function of the male badge in the species. Anderson also explores the role of the House Sparrow in disease transmission to humans and their domesticated animals.},

Especially, the vegetation index of Terra/MODIS-EVI is believed to have the highest sensitivity to the seasonality of vegetation. This study compares the reflection susceptibility of three vegetation indices (NOAA/AVHRR-NDVI, Terra/MODIS-NDVI and Terra/MODIS-EVI) to the seasonal variations of vegetation in the mid-south of Yunnan Province of China. It has been found that Terra/MODIS-EVI does best in the elimination of external disturbance. Firstly, it obviously improves the linear relationship with vegetation cover degree, especially in the high vegetation coverage area. Secondly, it avoids the emergence of vegetation index saturation. Thirdly, it reduces the environmental influence including both effects of atmosphere and soil. So it is believed that the Terra/MODIS-EVI can offer excellent tool for quantitative research of remote sensing, and has realized to be oriented by data with high quality.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In wildlife populations, group-living is thought to increase the probability of parasite transmission because contact rates increase at high host densities. Physical contact, such as social grooming, is an important component of group structure, but it can also increase the risk of exposure to infection for individuals because it provides a mechanism for transmission of potentially pathogenic organisms. Living in groups can also create variation in susceptibility to infection among individuals because circulating levels of immunosuppressive hormones like glucocorticoids often depend on an individual's position within the group's social structure. Yet, little is known about the relative roles of socially mediated exposure versus susceptibility in parasite transmission among free-living animal groups. To address this issue, we investigate the relationship between host dominance hierarchy and nematode parasite transmission among females in a wild group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui). We use social network analysis to describe each individual female's position within the grooming network in relation to dominance rank and relative levels of infection. Our results suggest that the number of directly-transmitted parasite species infecting each female, and the relative amount of transmission stages that one of these species sheds in faeces, both increase with dominance rank. Female centrality within the network, which shows positive associations with dominance hierarchy, is also positively associated with infection by certain parasite species, suggesting that the measured rank-bias in transmission may reflect variation in exposure rather than susceptibility. This is supported by the lack of a clear relationship between rank and faecal cortisol, as an indicator of stress, in a subset of these females. Thus, socially mediated exposure appears to be important for direct transmission of nematode parasites, lending support to the idea that a classical fitness trade-off inherent to living in groups can exist.},

abstract = {Questions: Uncertainty in detecting disturbance histories has long been ignored in dendrochronological studies in forest ecosystems. Our goal was to characterize this uncertainty in relation to the key parameters of forest ecosystems and sample size. In addition, we aimed to provide a method to define uncertainty bounds in specific forest ecosystems with known parameters, and to provide a required (conservative) minimal sample size to achieve a pre-defined level of uncertainty if no actual key forest parameters are known. Location: Training data were collected from {\v{Z}}of{\'{i}}nsk{\'{y}} Prales (48°40'N, 14°42'E, 735-830. m a.s.l., granite, Czech Republic). Methods: We used probability theory and expressed uncertainty as the length (the difference between the upper and lower bounds) of the 95{\%} confidence interval. We studied the uncertainty of (i) the initial growth of trees - if they originated under canopy or in a gap, and (ii) the responses to disturbance events during subsequent growth - on the basis of release detection in the radial growth of trees. These two variables provide different information, which together give a picture of the disturbance history. While initial growth date the existence of a gap in a given decade (recent as well as older gaps are included), release demonstrates the moment of a disturbance event. Results: With the help of general mathematical deduction, we have obtained results valid across vegetation types. The length of a confidence interval depends on the sample size, proportion of released trees in a population, as well as on the variability of tree layer features (e.g., crown area of suppressed and released trees). Conclusions: Most studies to date have evaluated the initial growth of trees with higher uncertainty than for canopy disturbed area. The length of the 95{\%} confidence interval for detecting initial growth has been rarely shorter than 0.1 (error. ±. 5{\%}) and has mostly been much longer. To reach 95{\%} confidence interval length of 0.1 (error. ±. 5{\%}) when detecting the canopy disturbed area, at least 485 tree cores should be evaluated in studied time period, while to reach a 0.05 interval length (error. ±. 2.5{\%}) at least 1925 tree cores are required. Our approach can be used to find the required sample size in each specific forest ecosystem to achieve pre-defined levels of uncertainty while detecting disturbance history.},

This was done either by using the mechanical disrupter by Mini BeadBeater 8, or the TissueLyser both followed by DNA purification using QIAamp DNA stool MiniKit, in comparison with DNA extractions using QIAamp DNA stool MiniKit without any prior mechanical disruption, according to manufacturer's instructions. The obtained DNA from the three procedures was analysed by DGGE, and the number of bands was compared between each procedure. There was no significant difference between the numbers of bacterial bands obtained from DGGE when using a TissueLyser or Mini BeadBeater 8, so the two different mechanical cell disruptors can be used comparably when isolating bacterial DNA from faecal samples. The QIAamp DNA stool MiniKit alone resulted in a reduced number of bands compared to the two mechanical disruption methods.},

In recent years many studies have shown that biodiversity, and in particular functional diversity, can enhance ecosystem resilience by providing a higher response diversity2–5 . So far these insights have been mostly neglected in large-scale projections of ecosystem responses to climate change6 . Here we show that plant trait diversity, as a key component of functional diversity, can have a strikingly positive effect on the Amazon forests' biomass under future climate change. Using a terrestrial biogeochemical model that simulates diverse forest communities on the basis of individual tree growth7 , we show that plant trait diversity may enable the Amazon forests to adjust to new climate conditions via a process of ecological sorting, protecting the Amazon's carbon sink function. Therefore, plant trait diversity, and biodiversity in general, should be considered in large-scale ecosystem projections and be included as an integral part of climate change research and policy.},

abstract = {Positive biotic interactions play a significant role in shap- ing ecological communities. We used an individual-based model to demonstrate that plant facilitation on a microscale may cause ecosys- tem shifts on a landscape scale that can be announced by generic early- warning indicators. Recruitment of woody plants in harsh environ- ments such as drylands often depends on nurse plants that ameliorate stressful conditions and facilitate the establishment of seedlings under their canopy. We found that these facilitative interactions may cause a treeless and a woodland state to be alternative stable states on a land- scape scale if nurse plant effects are strong and if the environment is harsh enough to make facilitation necessary for seedling survival. A corollary is that under such conditions environmental change can bring drylands to tipping points for woody plant encroachment or woodland collapse. We show that the proximity of tipping points may be indicated by slowness of recovery of woody vegetation cover from small perturbations as well as by elevated temporal and spatial auto- correlation and variance. These signs are known to be indicators of crit- ical slowing down. This is the first demonstration that the systemic phe- nomena of tipping points, announced by critical slowing down as a warning signal, may plausibly arise from microscale individual inter- actions, such as plant facilitation.},

Knowledge regarding the resilience of vegetation cover is important for understanding the potential impact of anthropic or climatic change. The length of time vegetation cover takes to recover from disturbances can provide an indication of ecosystem resilience. We investigated spatial and temporal patterns in the persistence of vegetation cover across southern Africa (1982-2006) and used persistence probability plots to estimate decay times of NDVI trends as a means to characterise the potential resilience of key southern African biomes. Patterns of positive and negative NDVI trend persistence were spatially coherent, indicating collective dynamic behaviour of vegetation cover. Persistence probability plots indicated differences in resilience between biomes. Mean recovery times from negative NDVI trends were shorter than for positive trends in the Savanna and Nama Karoo, whereas the Succulent Karoo exhibited the shortest mean lifetime for positive NDVI trends and one of the longest mean lifetimes for negative trend survival, implying potentially slow recovery from environmental disturbance. The results show the potential of satellite-time series data for monitoring vegetation cover resilience in semi-arid regions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review research conducted over the past decade on the application of multi-temporal remote sensing for monitoring changes of Arctic tundra lands. Emphasis is placed on results from the National Science Foundation Land-Air-Ice Interactions (LAII) program and on optical remote sensing techniques. Case studies demonstrate that ground-level sensors on stationary or moving track platforms and wide-swath imaging sensors on polar orbiting satellites are particularly useful for capturing optical remote sensing data at sufficient frequency to study tundra vegetation dynamics and changes for the cloud prone Arctic. Less frequent imaging with high spatial resolution instruments on aircraft and lower orbiting satellites enable more detailed analyses of land cover change and calibration/validation of coarser resolution observations. The strongest signals of ecosystem change detected thus far appear to correspond to expansion of tundra shrubs and changes in the amount and extent of thaw lakes and ponds. Changes in shrub cover and extent have been documented by modern repeat imaging that matches archived historical aerial photography. NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) time series provide a 20-year record for determining changes in greenness that relates to photosynthetic activity, net primary production, and growing season length. The strong contrast between land materials and surface waters enables changes in lake and pond extent to be readily measured and monitored. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rudgers2018,
abstract = {Understanding controls on net primary production (NPP) has been a long-standing goal in ecology. Climate is a well-known control on NPP, although the temporal differences among years within a site are often weaker than the spatial pattern of differences across sites. Climate sensitivity functions describe the relationship between an ecological response (e.g., NPP) and both the mean and variance of its climate driver (e.g., aridity index), providing a novel framework for under- standing how climate trends in both mean and variance vary with NPP over time. Nonlinearities in these functions predict whether an increase in climate variance will have a positive effect (convex nonlinearity) or negative effect (concave nonlinearity) on NPP. The influence of climate variance may be particularly intense at ecosystem transition zones, if species reach physiological thresholds that create nonlinearities at these ecotones. Long-term data collected at the confluence of three dryland ecosystems in central New Mexico revealed that each ecosystem exhibited a unique climate sensitivity function that was consistent with long-term vegetation change occurring at their ecotones. Our analysis suggests that rising temperatures in drylands could alter the nonlinearities that determine the relative costs and benefits of variance in precipitation for primary production.},

@article{Chuine2016,
abstract = {The onset of the growing season of trees has been earlier by 2.3 days per decade during the last 40 years in temperate Europe because of global warming. The effect of temperature on plant phenology is, however, not linear because temperature has a dual effect on bud development. On one hand, low temperatures are necessary to break bud endodormancy, and, on the other hand, higher temperatures are necessary to promote bud cell growth afterward. Different process-based models have been developed in the last decades to predict the date of budbreak of woody species. They predict that global warming should delay or compromise endodormancy break at the species equatorward range limits leading to a delay or even impossibility to flower or set new leaves. These models are classically parameterized with flowering or budbreak dates only, with no information on the endodormancy break date because this information is very scarce. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of a set of phenological models to accurately predict the endodormancy break dates of three fruit trees. Our results show that models calibrated solely with budbreak dates usually do not accurately predict the endodormancy break date. Providing endodormancy break date for the model parameterization results in much more accurate prediction of this latter, with, however, a higher error than that on budbreak dates. Most importantly, we show that models not calibrated with endodormancy break dates can generate large discrepancies in forecasted budbreak dates when using climate scenarios as compared to models calibrated with endodormancy break dates. This discrepancy increases with mean annual temperature and is therefore the strongest after 2050 in the southernmost regions. Our results claim for the urgent need of massive measurements of endodormancy break dates in forest and fruit trees to yield more robust projections of phenological changes in a near future.},

abstract = {* Environmental policy instruments often require that natural resource managers safeguard the resilience of ecosystems. However, ‘resilience' has been a difficult concept to operationalise. Two forms of resilience are recognised in the ecological literature. ‘Ecological resilience' concerns ecosystems that possess alternative equilibrial states (attractors) and has been operationalised in a few systems. ‘Engineering resilience' was developed for ecosystems with a single attractor, but its use is confined to systems that gravitate towards a stable equilibrium. * We present a general method to quantify engineering resilience that can be applied irrespective of an ecosystem's stability or proclivity to obey multiple attractors. The technique uses a system model to distinguish the effects of globally driven (and essentially unmanageable) stressors, such as climate change and ocean acidification, from regional- and local-scale (manageable) stressors on the ecosystem. * We illustrate the technique using a simple coral reef model and find it able to calculate the impacts of managing crown-of-thorns starfish against a background of increasing stress from climate change and ocean acidification. * Resilience analyses using our approach help assess the relative importance of local- or regional-scale management interventions under varying degrees of global environmental change, even if they preside over long-term ecosystem decline. Several frameworks of varying complexity are provided to guide the linkage of resilience metrics to environmental decision-making.},

@article{Riera1998,
abstract = {We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity in vegetation indices among 13 North American landscapes by using full Landsat Thematic Mapper images. Landscapes varied broadly in the statistical distribution of vegetation indices, but were successfully ordinated by using a measure of central tendency (the mean) and a measure of dispersion (the standard deviation or the coefficient of variation). Differences in heterogeneity among landscapes were explained by their topographic relief and their land cover. Landscape heterogeneity (standard deviation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) tended to increase linearly with topographic relief (standard deviation of elevation), but landscapes with low relief were much more heterogeneous than expected from this relationship. The latter were characterized by a large proportion of agricultural land. Percent agriculture, in turn, was inversely related to topographic relief. The strength of these relationships was evaluated against changes in image spatial resolution (grain size). Aggregation of NDVI images to coarser grain size resulted in steady decline of their standard deviation. Although the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and explanatory variables was generally preserved, rates of decrease in heterogeneity with grain size differed among landscapes. A spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that rates of decrease were related to the scale at which pattern is manifested. On one end of the spectrum are agricultural, low- relief landscapes with low spatial autocorrelation and small- scale heterogeneity associated with fields; their heterogeneity decreased sharply as grain size increased. At the other end, desert landscapes were characterized by low small-scale heterogeneity, high spatial autocorrelation, and almost no change in heterogeneity as grain sized was increased-their heterogeneity, associated with land forms, was present at a large scale.},

Most domesticates have their origin in one of a few historic centers of domestication as farm animals. Two notable exceptions are cats and dogs. Wolf domestication was initiated late in the Mesolithic when humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Those wolves less afraid of humans scavenged nomadic hunting camps and over time developed utility, initially as guards warning of approaching animals or other nomadic bands and soon thereafter as hunters, an attribute tuned by artificial selection. The first domestic cats had limited utility and initiated their domestication among the earliest agricultural Neolithic settlements in the Near East. Wildcat domestication occurred through a self-selective process in which behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as a correlated character of assortative mating coupled to habitat choice for urban environments. Eurasian wildcats initiated domestication and their evolution to companion animals was initially a process of natural, rather than artificial, selection over time driven during their sympatry with forbear wildcats.},

MMT, 0000-0003-3949-6958; SRW, 0000-0002-7089-4594 Agriculture is a dominant evolutionary force that drives the evolution of both domesticated and wild species. However, the various mechanisms of agricul-ture-induced evolution and their socio-ecological consequences are not often synthetically discussed. Here, we explore how agricultural practices and evol-utionary changes in domesticated species cause evolution in wild species. We do so by examining three processes by which agriculture drives evolution. First, differences in the traits of domesticated species, compared with their wild ancestors, alter the selective environment and create opportunities for wild species to specialize. Second, selection caused by agricultural practices, including both those meant to maximize productivity and those meant to con-trol pest species, can lead to pest adaptation. Third, agriculture can cause non-selective changes in patterns of gene flow in wild species. We review evidence for these processes and then discuss their ecological and sociological impacts. We finish by identifying important knowledge gaps and future directions related to the eco-evolutionary impacts of agriculture including their extent, how to prevent the detrimental evolution of wild species, and finally, how to use evolution to minimize the ecological impacts of agriculture. This article is part of the themed issue 'Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences'.},

A review of case studies: 

Article asks: How do agricultural practices and evolution of domesticated species drive evolutionary changes in wild species? What are the ecological and societal consequences of these evolutionary changes?

"Now encompassing approximately 40{\%} of Earth's land surface, agriculture has replaced the majority of Earth's grasslands, savannahs and vast swathes of forest [4]. Agriculture is also responsible for 30–35{\%} of global carbon emissions, 70{\%} of global freshwater withdrawals and a 500{\%} increase in global fertilizer use over the past 50 years [4]" As host races continue to diverge, theymay eventually form incipient species, as has been docu- mented in Rhagoletis flies after they shifted from wild hawthorn to domesticated apples [16,17].

We have noticed that some wild species have adapted to some crops such as "Colias butterflies have shifted hosts from wild legumes to domesticated alfalfa, leading to genetically distinct ‘pest' and ‘non-pest' populations, each of which performs better on its own host [15]."

1 (Adapataion to agricultural instesification) Homogenius agricultural habitats are especially bad because species evolution to the crops is enhanced when the selection pressure is constant. Studies have linked homegeneity with more rapid pest evolution, as a result there have been numberous calls to diversify agricultural systems, which could help to slow down the process. 

2 (Adaptation to cultural practices) cultural practices that we have used over the last few thousand years that are non chemical have still infuenced wild species. A classic example is barnyard grass, a native of east asia rice fields has evolved to look like rice to avoid being hand weeded/ its seeds also mimic those of rice to survive seed sorting and cleaning. Also, crop rotation between corn and soy has traditionally been used in the US to help avoid pests. But the corn rootworms have evolved to survive this and can now either eat soy or "diapause" (fasting for 2 years)

3 (Adaptation in response to pesticides)
"A number of factors dictate the rate and frequency of pesticide evolution. The scale of agriculture and application rate of pesticides is key, as well as the enormous population sizes of the pest species, which increases the likelihood that resistant genotypes already exist [23]. In addition, certain pesticides have very targetedmechanisms of action that could be undermined by a single dominant allele [38]. Moreover, resistance in microbial pests can sometimes be transferred across species by way of horizontal gene or plasmid transfer [39,40]. 
"A dramatic example of insecticide resistance is the
Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), a highly problematic potato pest that has evolved resistance to at least 55 active ingredients designed for its control [37]."
-it is also estimated that over 530 species of weed have evolved resistence to herbiceds alone. 


Also gene mixing from farmed animals into their wild counterparts can have bad effects on the wild species. Bad genes can be transferred to offspring and reduce the productivity of wild populations in years to come, this has been documented in fish. This can also be true for plants

Becuase some pests are quite bad for our crops, we have to use increasing amounts of pesticides to kill them. This could potentially affect out ecosystem services such as pollination, water quality and biodiversity and human health. Also we are killing the natural predators of some pests

You may find it useful to start by reading the second part first, identify which chapters are relevant, and then read the corresponding theory chapters from part one.

abstract = {Grazing and fire are disturbances integral to the evolution and maintenance of savanna grasslands. Humans are altering or completely eliminating these disturbance regimes at a global scale, with important consequences for savanna ecosystem structure and function. It is unknown whether the alteration of these disturbance regimes will have similar effects on grass communities of savanna grasslands in different geographic regions that vary in their biogeographic and evolutionary histories, as well as in the diversity of extant grazers. Here, we examined the effects of large herbivore loss on different aspects of grass community structure - taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional - across a range of fire frequencies in C-4-dominated mesic savanna grassland sites of North America (Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, USA) and South Africa (Kruger National Park). The goal of the study was to determine whether the loss of large herbivores exerted a consistent effect on the grass communities of two physiognomically similar grasslands with different biogeographic and grazing histories. The removal of large herbivores resulted in divergent responses in the grass communities at Konza and Kruger that was consistent across fire treatments. At Konza, there was a rapid and significant response to grazing exclusion while the response was muted and transient at Kruger. Functional syndromes associated with grazing resistance were generally conserved across sites, and it was the functional strategies of the dominant species at each site that drove the divergent responses. Further, our study supports the hypothesis that grazing and aridity may be selective forces that act in parallel as those species that were grazing resistant also occupied drier niches.Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that savanna grassland communities with different biogeographic and grazing histories respond differently to the removal of large herbivores and that climate, fire and grazing are interactive forces in maintaining savanna grassland diversity and function. We show that the functional attributes of the dominant grasses, which are in part driven by the biogeographic and grazing history experienced, are the most relevant in predicting the response of savanna ecosystems to the loss of large herbivores.},

abstract = {Abstract. ERA-Interim/Land is a global land surface reanalysis data set covering the period 1979–2010. It describes the evolution of soil moisture, soil temperature and snowpack. ERA-Interim/Land is the result of a single 32-year simulation with the latest ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on monthly GPCP v2.1 (Global Precipitation Climatology Project). The horizontal resolution is about 80 km and the time frequency is 3-hourly. ERA-Interim/Land includes a number of parameterization improvements in the land surface scheme with respect to the original ERA-Interim data set, which makes it more suitable for climate studies involving land water resources. The quality of ERA-Interim/Land is assessed by comparing with ground-based and remote sensing observations. In particular, estimates of soil moisture, snow depth, surface albedo, turbulent latent and sensible fluxes, and river discharges are verified against a large number of site measurements. ERA-Interim/Land provides a global integrated and coherent estimate of soil moisture and snow water equivalent, which can also be used for the initialization of numerical weather prediction and climate models.},

abstract = {Ecological niche models and species distribution models are becoming important elements in the toolkit of biogeographers and ecologists. Although burgeoning in use, much variation exists in implementation of these techniques, leading to considerable diversity of methodology and discussion of what is the 'best' approach. In this analysis, we explore implications of different configurations of major factors that constrain species' distributions-abiotic factors and dispersal limitation-for the success or failure of these models. We analyze variation in performance among modeling approaches as a function of the relative configuration of these two factors and the spatial extent of training region, with the result that a clear understanding of the abiotic-dispersal configuration is a prerequisite to effective model implementations; the effects of spatial extent of the training region are less consistent and clear. Model development will be powerful only when set in an appropriate and explicit biogeographic and population ecological context. {\textcopyright} 2012 .},

Understanding these processes is critical for predicting and handling human-biodiversity interactions and global change dynamics such as food and energy security, ecosystem services, climate change, and species invasions. The Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) database comprises an unprecedented wealth of cleaned and standardised botanical data, containing roughly 81 million occurrence records from c. 375,000 species, c. 915,000 trait observations across 28 traits from c. 93,000 species, and co-occurrence records from 110,000 ecological plots globally, as well as 100,000 range maps and 100 replicated phylogenies (each containing 81,274 species) for New World species. Here, we describe an r package that provides easy access to these data. The bien r package allows users to access the multiple types of data in the BIEN database. Functions in this package query the BIEN database by turning user inputs into optimised PostgreSQL functions. Function names follow a convention designed to make it easy to understand what each function does. We have also developed a protocol for providing customised citations and herbarium acknowledgements for data downloaded through the bien r package. The development of the BIEN database represents a significant achievement in biological data integration, cleaning and standardization. Likewise, the bien r package represents an important tool for open science that makes the BIEN database freely and easily accessible to everyone.},

A simulation modelling approach was used to examine the resilience of four coral species with differing life history characteristics: Agaricia agaricites, A. lamarcki, Helioseris cucullata, and Porites astreoides. Resilience, defined as the rate of area (coral cover) gain, was greater for three of the species when storms were less frequent or more intense. Resilience for all species increased with colony growth rates and with increasing proportion of small and medium-sized colonies. We conclude that (1) coral populations composed of intermediate-size, fast-growing colonies the most resilient following one or more storm disturbances, and (2) that resilience of anthropogenically stressed corals depends, in part, on population size structure.},

@article{Sandel2015,
abstract = {Aim Do plant trait databases represent a biased sample of species, and if so, can that bias be corrected? Ecologists are increasingly collecting and analysing data on plant functional traits, and contributing them to large plant trait databases. Many applications of such databases involve merging trait measurements with other data such as species distributions in vegetation plots; a process that invariably produces matrices with incomplete trait and species data. Typically, missing data are simply ignored and it is assumed that the missing species are missing at random. Methods Here, we argue that this assumption is unlikely to be valid and propose an approach for estimating the strength of the bias regarding which species are represented in trait databases. The method leverages the fact that, within a given database, some species have many measurements of a trait and others have few (high vs low measurement intensity). In the absence of bias, there should be no relationship between measurement intensity and trait values. We demonstrate the method using five traits that are part of the TRY database, a global archive of plant traits. Our method also leads naturally to a correction for this bias, which we validate and apply to two examples. Results Specific leaf area and seed mass were strongly positively biased (frequently measured species had higher trait values than rarely measured species), leaf nitrogen per unit mass and maximum height were moderately negatively biased, and maximum photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area was weakly negatively biased. The bias-correction method yielded greatly improved estimates in the validation tests for the two most biased traits. Further, in our two applications, ecological interpretations were shown to be sensitive to uncorrected bias in the data. Conclusions Species inclusion in trait databases appears to be strongly biased in some cases, and failure to correct this can lead to incorrect conclusions.},

abstract = {Under climate change, not only the magnitude, but also the frequency of extreme weather events is predicted to increase. Such repeated climate stress events may cause fundamental shifts in species compositions or ecosystem functioning. Yet, few studies document such shifts. One reason for higher stability of ecosystems than previously expected may be ecological stress memory at the single plant level. Ecological stress memory is defined here as any response of a single plant after a stress experience that modifies the response of the plant towards future stress events including the mode of interaction with other ecological units. Ecological stress memory is assessed on a whole plant level in ecological relevant parameters. It is therefore one important aspect of the broader concept of ecological memory that refers to whole communities and ecosystems. Here, we present studies which indicate the existence of ecological stress memory within single plants after drought, frost or heat stress. Possible mechanisms underlying an ecological stress memory are the accumulation of proteins, transcription factors or protective metabolites, as well as epigenetic modifications or morphological changes. In order to evaluate the importance of stress memory for stabilizing whole ecosystems and communities in times of climate change, cooperation between ecologists and molecular biologists is urgently needed, as well as more studies investigating stress memory on a single plant level. Only then the potential of plant stress memory for stabilizing ecosystems in times of intensifying climatic extremes can be evaluated and taken into account for measures of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The principle motivation for formulating EASS is to provide realistic partition of energy fluxes at regional scales as well as consistent estimates of carbon assimilation rates. EASS has the following characteristics: (i) satellite data are used to describe the spatial and temporal information on vegetation, and in particular, we use a foliage clumping index (??) in addition to leaf area index to characterize the effects of three-dimensional canopy structure on radiation, energy and carbon fluxes; (ii) energy and water exchanges and carbon assimilation in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system are fully coupled and are simulated simultaneously; (iii) the energy and carbon assimilation fluxes are calculated with stratification of sunlit and shaded leaves to avoid shortcomings of the "big-leaf" assumption. Model experiments shows that the simulation realism and accuracy by the new strategy are enhanced about 9-14{\%} compared with the "big-leaf model". Moreover, ?? is useful for accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves in the canopy. The accuracy in simulation of energy and carbon fluxes increase about 5-8{\%} by considering the effects of ?? on the radiation interception and the separation of sunlit and shaded leaves; (iv) snow and soil simulations are emphasized by including a flexible and multiple layer scheme. EASS has been tested and validated against multiple-year observed data at several sites. EASS is proved to be overall successful in capturing variations in energy fluxes, canopy and soil temperatures, and soil moisture over diurnal, synoptic, seasonal and inter-annual temporal scales. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A model to predict global patterns in vegetation physiognomy was developed from physiological considerations influencing the distributions of different functional types of plant. Primary driving variables are mean coldest-month temperature, annual accumulated temperature over 5-degrees-C, and a drought index incorporating the seasonality of precipitation and the available water capacity of the soil. The model predicts which plant types can occur in a given environment, and selects the potentially dominant types from among them. Biomes arise as combinations of dominant types. Global environmental data were supplied as monthly means of temperature, precipitation and sunshine (interpolated to a global 0.5-degrees grid, with a lapse-rate correction) and soil texture class. The resulting predictions of global vegetation patterns were in good agreement with the mapped distribution of actual ecosystem complexes (Olson, J.S., Watts, J.A. {\&} Allison, L.J.

abstract = {All ecosystems are exposed to gradual changes in climate, nutrient loading, habitat fragmentation or biotic exploitation. Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

abstract = {The 16-day composite MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) at 500-m resolution for the period between 2000 to 2007 were seasonally averaged on the basis of the estimated distribution of 16 potential natural terrestrial ecosystems (NTEs) across Turkey. Graphical and statistical analyses of the time-series VIs for the NTEs spatially disaggregated in terms of biogeoclimate zones and land cover types included descriptive statistics, correlations, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), time-series decomposition, and simple linear regression (SLR) models. Our spatio-temporal analyses revealed that both MODIS VIs, on average, depicted similar seasonal variations for the NTEs, with the NDVI values having higher mean and SD values. The seasonal VIs were most correlated in decreasing order for: barren/sparsely vegetated land {\textgreater} grassland {\textgreater} shrubland/woodland {\textgreater} forest; (sub)nival {\textgreater} warm temperate {\textgreater} alpine {\textgreater} cool temperate {\textgreater} boreal = Mediterranean; and summer {\textgreater} spring {\textgreater} autumn {\textgreater} winter. Most pronounced differences between the MODIS VI responses over Turkey occurred in boreal and Mediterranean climate zones and forests, and in winter (the senescence phase of the growing season). Our results showed the potential of the time-series MODIS VI datasets in the estimation and monitoring of seasonal and interannual ecosystem dynamics over Turkey that needs to be further improved and refined through systematic and extensive field measurements and validations across various biomes.},

abstract = {In a range of plant species from three Californian vegetation types, we examined the widely used "normalized difference vegetation index" (NDVI) and "simple ratio" (SR) as indicators of canopy structure, light absorption, and photosynthetic activity. These indices, which are derived from canopy reflectance in the red and near-infrared wavebands, highlighted phenological differences between evergreen and deciduous canopies. They were poor indicators of total canopy biomass due to the varying abundance of non-green standing biomass in these vegetation types. However, in sparse canopies (leaf area index [LAI]°0-2), NDVI was a sensitive indicator of canopy structure and chemical content (green biomass, green leaf area index, chlorophyll content, and foliar nitrogen content). At higher canopy green LAI values ({\textgreater}2; typical of dense shrubs and trees), NDVI was relatively insensitive to changes in canopy structure. Compared to SR, NDVI was better correlated with indicators of canopy structure and chemical content, but was equivalent to the logarithm of SR. In agreement with theoretical expectations, both NDVI and SR exhibited near-linear correlations with fractional PAR intercepted by green leaves over a wide range of canopy densities. Maximum daily photosynthetic rates were positively correlated with NDVI and SR in annual grassland and semideciduous shrubs where canopy development and photosynthetic activity were in synchrony. The indices were also correlated with peak springtime canopy photosynthetic rates in evergreens. However, over most of the year, these indices were poor predictors of photosynthetic performance in evergreen species due to seasonal reductions in photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency that occurred without substantial declines in canopy greenness. Our results support the use of these vegetation indices as remote indicators of PAR absorption, and thus potential photosynthetic activity, even in heterogeneous landscapes. To provide accurate estimates of vegetation-atmosphere gas fluxes, remote NDVI and SR measurements need to be coupled with careful estimates of canopy photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency.},

Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Whether birds and mammals adaptively adjust their offspring sex ratios in response to their environment is much debated. A source of confusion is that different studies show different patterns, with sex ratio adjustment appearing to occur in some cases but not others. The extent to which this reflects interesting biological variation due to differences in the underlying selective forces, as opposed to statistical noise, is not clear. Cooperatively breeding species offer an opportunity to address this problem because the strength of selection on sex ratio adjustment can be estimated. When helping behavior is sex dependent, parents are predicted to overproduce the helping sex when this sex is rare or absent. We show here that the extent of this behavior depends on the benefit that helpers bring to parents: there is greater sex ratio adjustment when helpers bring larger benefits. Variable selection on sex ratio adjustment may thus explain variable empirical findings. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recreational trampling damage of natural vegetation is an increasing problem in the global context and has the potential to impact on vegetation communities that are of high ecological and socio-economic interest. Wildflower tourism in the national parks of southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has the potential to damage the flora on which it depends through trampling. Little research has been previously undertaken in these largely shrub-dominated communities to identify and quantify such impacts. This study is the first to do so, using observational studies of tourists, a descriptive study, and trampling experiments. The behaviours of independent tourists and tour groups were observed. Of the 213 independent visitors observed 41 visitors left trails to view flowers and in the process trampled vegetation. Vegetation height and cover were measured at three sites frequented by wildflower tourists. Vegetation height and cover declined in response to use by tourists. Trampling experiments, which relied on trampling treatments of 0, 30, 100, 200, 300/500 passes, where 0 passes represents the control, were applied at four sites. Trampling led to a significant reduction in vegetation height immediately post- treatment, for all treatments, with a non-significant recovery over time. Trampling also significantly reduced vegetation cover, with the resistance indices for these experimental sites ranging from 30 to 300 passes. Collectively these results illustrate the low resilience and resistance of these valued communities and the possible impacts of wildflower and other nature based tourism, through trampling. The paper concludes with suggested management strategies, which strongly emphasise the importance of education for the tourism industry and provide for international comparisons in regard to recreational trampling impacts on biodiverse shrub land communities.},

abstract = {Troop takeover is common in one-male primate groups, but there are few reports in multimale groups. Japanese macaques ( Macaca fuscata ) form multimale groups and males commonly join troops at the bottom rank. On Yakushima island, however, where group size is relatively small, entrance into groups at the alpha position is also observed. This paper reports on the general features of troop takeover, on the predictors of takeover events, and on the reproductive success of takeover males. Troop takeovers occurred only in the mating season; nontroop males (NTMs) did not cooperate with each other; former alpha males were rarely expelled from the troop; new alpha males did not commit infanticide; new alpha male tenure in the group was usually less than two years. Logistic regression analysis showed that the number of NTMs associating with a troop predicted the occurrence of troop takeover. Paternity discrimination revealed that 33.3{\%} (3/9) of takeover males succeeded in siring offspring. Contrary to this low success rate, binary logistic regression analysis revealed that the takeover males can expect higher reproductive success compared to troop males. Entering a troop and out-competing the alpha male is one of many available strategies to attain reproductive success in male Japanese macaques.},

abstract = {Biomes are important constructs for organising understanding of how the worlds major terrestrial ecosystems differ from one another and for monitoring change in these ecosystems. Yet existing biome schemes have been criticised for being overly subjective and for explicitly or implicitly invoking climate. We propose a new biome map and classification scheme that uses information on (1) an index of vegetation productivity, (2) whether the minimum of vegetation activity is in the driest or coldest part of the year and (3) vegetation height. Although biomes produced on the basis of this classification show a strong spatial coherence, they show little congruence with existing biome classification schemes. Our study provides an alternative classification scheme for synthesising data of the biogeochemical rates of terrestrial ecosystems. We further use this new biome classification scheme to analyse patterns of biome change observed over recent decades. Overall 13{\%} of analysed pixels shifted in biome state over the 30 year study period. A wide range of biome transitions were observed. For example, biomes with tall vegetation and seasonality associated with cold in the unfavourable growing period shifted to higher productivity biome states. Sites dominated by biomes characterized by short vegetation and low seasonality shifted to seasonally moisture limited biome states. Our findings and method provide a new source of data for rigorously monitoring global vegetation change, analysing drivers of vegetation change and for benchmarking models of terrestrial ecosystem function.

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

Remote sensing and GIS applications are valuable tools providing cost-efficient information on vegetation recovery patterns and their associated environmental factors. In this study we used an ordinal classification scheme to describe the land cover changes induced by a wildfire that occurred in 1983 in Pinus brutia woodlands on Karpathos Aegean Island, south-eastern Greece. As a proxy variable that indicates ecosystem recovery, we also estimated the difference between the NDVI and NBR indices a few months (1984) and almost 30 years after the fire (2012). Environmental explanatory variables were selected using a digital elevation model and various thematic maps. To identify the most influential environmental factors contributing to woodland recovery, binary logistic regression and linear regression techniques were applied. The analyses showed that although a large proportion of the P. brutia woodland has recovered 26 years after the fire event, a considerable amount of woodland had turned into scrub vegetation. Altitude, slope inclination, solar radiation, and pre-fire woodland physiognomy were identified as dominant factors influencing the vegetation's recovery probability. Additionally, altitude and inclination are the variables that explain changes in the satellite remote sensing vegetation indices reflecting the recovery potential. Pinus brutia showed a good post-fire recovery potential, especially in parts of the study area with increased moisture availability.},

abstract = {An increasing number of climate modelling studies use a general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), yet the intrinsic properties of DGVMs and the feedbacks in this coupled system have not been fully investigated. Here we present details of several intrinsic properties of an established DGVM, TRIFFID, and its coupling with the Hadley Centre GCM. A new version of TRIFFID is first developed which is able to reproduce much of the behaviour of TRIFFID, yet is simple enough to be investigated analytically. This is used to show: (1) TRIFFID has a single stable equilibrium vegetation coverage, which depends on environmental conditions, (2) the dominant timescale of changes in vegetation structure is variable and is determined by environmental conditions through photosynthesis, and (3) TRIFFID damps out variability at periods less than the response timescale. From these results we conclude that the variability of the vegetation structure, and hence vegetation feedbacks can damp or amplify atmospheric variability through a shift in the response timescale, i.e. that vegetation feedbacks to the atmosphere are sensitive to the period of the atmospheric variability. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Resilience is usually defined as the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb distur- bance without shifting to an alternative state and losing function and services [1–3]. The concept therefore encompasses two separate processes: resistance—the magnitude of disturbance that causes a change in structure—and recovery—the speed of return to the original structure [4,5]—which are fundamentally different but rarely distinguished. Yet, resilience has become a central concept in the manage- ment of natural ecosystems [6,7]. Many current management actions aim to alle- viate local stressors in an effort to increase ecosystem resilience to global climate change [8,9]. Such a management philos- ophy is premised on the belief that eliminating local drivers of ecological change will increase the ability of an ecosystem to resist future climate distur- bances, its ability to recover from such disturbances, or both [2,6]. Measuring resilience is fraught with difficulties [1,3]. Nevertheless, assessing changes in resil- ience as a result of management action is critical because there is general agreement for the existence of a strong link between resilience and sustainability [10]. Success- fully increasing the resilience of natural systems may therefore have important implications for human welfare in the face of global climate change.},

abstract = {The structure and function of alluvial Highly Dynamic River Systems (HDRS) are driven by highly variable hydrological disturbance regimes, and alternate between resistant, metastable states and resilient, transitional states. These are in turn subject to influences of feedback loops within hydrogeomorphic and biological processes. Here we consider how resistance and resilience largely determine HDRS ecosystem trajectories and how these characteristics can be modified by natural and anthropogenic processes. We review the mechanisms by which biodiversity can affect both resistance and resilience and introduce a conceptual framework that incorporates some unique HDRS characteristics. We suggest that resilient and resistant patterns frequently coexist in the active tract of these river systems, and that this coexistance promotes the return of metastable states after major disturbances. In contrast, highly resistant and poorly resilient patterns dominate at their external boundaries. The loss of these natural dynamics resulting from direct and indirect human impacts causes deviations to resistance and resilience patterns and therefore to HDRS trajectory. We propose that understanding the role of interactions between biological and physical processes that control resistance and resilience is crucial for system restoration and management.},

abstract = {Lice are socially-transmitted ectoparasites. Transmission depends upon their host's degree of contact with conspecifics. While grooming facilitates ectoparasite transmission via body contact, it also constrains their spread through parasite removal. We investigated relations between parasite burden and sociality in female Japanese macaques following two opposing predictions: i) central females in contact/grooming networks harbour more lice, related to their numerous contacts; ii) central females harbour fewer lice, related to receiving more grooming. We estimated lice load non-invasively using the conspicuous louse egg-picking behaviour performed by macaques during grooming. We tested for covariation in several centrality measures and lice load, controlling for season, female reproductive state and dominance rank. Results show that the interaction between degree centrality (number of partners) and seasonality predicted lice load: females interacting with more partners had fewer lice than those interacting with fewer partners in winter and summer, whereas there was no relationship between lice load and centrality in spring and fall. This is counter to the prediction that increased contact leads to greater louse burden but fits the prediction that social grooming limits louse burden. Interactions between environmental seasonality and both parasite and host biology appeared to mediate the role of social processes in louse burden.},

abstract = {In this study, outputs of three statistical downscaling (SD) methods including the change factor (Delta), simplified (simQP) and advanced (wetQP) quantile-perturbation-based approaches were compared based on daily rainfall series at 9 meteorological stations in the Lake Victoria basin (LVB) in Eastern Africa. The comparison was made considering phase 5 and phase 3 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, i.e. CMIP5 and CMIP3 respectively. For the CMIP5 (CMIP3) at each station, there were a total of 7 (14) GCMs, 18 (20) daily historical (control) simulations over the period 1961-2000, and 35 (49) daily future projection series of the periods 2050s and 2090s. The ensemble mean of the GCMs' Bias in reproducing rainfall extremes for return periods in the range of 1 to 40 years for the CMIP5 (CMIP3) varied from -19.05{\%} to 3.11{\%} (-65.85{\%} to -4.86{\%}). For the high greenhouse gas scenario rcp8.5 (A2) of the CMIP5 (CMIP3), the ensemble mean of the projected changes over the LVB in the 10-year rainfall intensity quantile obtained from the Delta, simQP, wetQP SD goes up to 5.8, 10 and 22.4{\%} (11.7, 15.9 and 43.6{\%}) in the 2050s and 8, 11.4, and 25.4{\%} (14.2, 23.3 and 40.6{\%}) in the 2090s. Rainfall totals of the main wet (dry) season are generally projected to increase (decrease) in both the 2050s and 2090s. Because the outputs from the three SD methods captured well the pattern of monthly rainfall totals, the difference between the projected changes of seasonal or annual rainfall totals from the Delta, simQP and wetQP was shown to be insignificant. However, the differences in the results from the Delta, simQP and wetQP methods with respect to the projections of rainfall quantiles indicate that the choice of the SD method can be made on a case by case basis in line with the objectives of the climate change impact study, e.g. the Delta does not capture well the changes in rainfall extremes, whereas the wetQP is suitable for both rainfall extremes and rainfall totals at both seasonal and annual time scales. The findings of this study also show the need to consider evaluations of the inter-GCM differences in the LVB as a data scarce region in assessing the discernible impact of climate change on rainfall extremes and/totals for decision making related to water resources management and engineering.},

@article{Kefi2013,
abstract = {Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as ‘generic early warning signals'. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as ‘critical slowing down' which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation – such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability.},

In this paper, we aim to provide a context and focus for linkages of resilience to natural resources management. We consider differences and similarities in resilience as presented in several disciplines relevant to resource management. We present a conceptual framework that includes environmental drivers, management interventions, and system responses cast in terms of system resilience, as well as a process for decision making that allows learning about system resilience through experience and incorporation of that learning into management. We discuss the current state of operational management for resilience, and suggest ways to improve it. Finally, we describe the challenges in managing for resilience and offer some recommendations about the scientific information needs and scientific issues relevant to making resilience a more meaningful component of natural resources management.},

@article{Todman2016,
abstract = {1 There are several conceptual definitions of resilience pertaining to environmental systems and, even if resilience is clearly defined in a particular context, it is challenging to quantify. We identify four characteristics of the response of a system function to disturbance that relate to " resilience " : (1) degree of return of the function to a reference level; (2) time taken to reach a new quasi-stable state; (3) rate (i.e. gradient) at which the function reaches the new state; (4) cumulative magnitude of the function (i.e. area under the curve) before a new state is reached. We develop metrics to quantify these characteristics based on an analogy with a mechanical spring and damper system. Using the example of the response of a soil function (respiration) to disturbance, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively discriminate key features of the dynamic response. Although any one of these characteristics could define resilience, each may lead to different insights and conclusions. The salient properties of a resilient response must thus be identified for different contexts. Because the temporal resolution of data affects the accurate determination of these metrics, we recommend that at least twelve measurements are made over the temporal range for which the response is expected.},

abstract = {Despite its ambiguities, the concept of resilience is of critical importance to researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers in dealing with dynamic socio-ecological systems. In this paper, we critically examine the three empirical approaches of (i) panarchy; (ii) ecological information-based network analysis; and (iii) statistical evidence of resilience to three criteria determined for achieving a comprehensive understanding and application of this concept. These criteria are the ability: (1) to reflect a system's adaptability to shocks; (2) to integrate social and environmental dimensions; and (3) to evaluate system-level trade-offs. Our findings show that none of the three currently applied approaches are strong in handling all three criteria. Panarchy is strong in the first two criteria but has difficulty with normative trade-offs. The ecological information-based approach is strongest in evaluating trade-offs but relies on common dimensions that lead to over-simplifications in integrating the social and environmental dimensions. Statistical evidence provides suggestions that are simplest and easiest to act upon but are generally weak in all three criteria. This analysis confirms the value of these approaches in specific instances but also the need for further research in advancing empirical approaches to the concept of resilience.},

Such signals have been sought for in abundance time-series data on a population of interest, with varying degrees of success. Here we move beyond these established methods by including parallel time-series data of abundance and fitness-related trait dynamics. Using data from a microcosm experiment, we show that including information on the dynamics of phenotypic traits such as body size into composite early warning indices can produce more accurate inferences of whether a population is approaching a critical transition than using abundance time-series alone. By including fitness-related trait information alongside traditional abundance-based early warning signals in a single metric of risk, our generalizable approach provides a powerful new way to assess what populations may be on the verge of collapse.},

abstract = {Aim: Two of the oldest observations in plant geography are the increase in plant diversity from the poles towards the tropics and the global geographic distribution of vegetation physiognomy (biomes). The objective of this paper is to use a process-based vegetation model to evaluate the relationship between modelled and observed global patterns of plant diversity and the geographic distribution of biomes. Location: The global terrestrial biosphere. Methods: We implemented and tested a novel vegetation model aimed at identifying strategies that enable plants to grow and reproduce within particular climatic conditions across the globe. Our model simulates plant survival according to the fundamental ecophysiological processes of water uptake, photosynthesis, reproduction and phenology. We evaluated the survival of an ensemble of 10,000 plant growth strategies across the range of global climatic conditions. For the simulated regional plant assemblages we quantified functional richness, functional diversity and functional identity. Results: A strong relationship was found (correlation coefficient of 0.75) between the modelled and the observed plant diversity. Our approach demonstrates that plant functional dissimilarity increases and then saturates with increasing plant diversity. Six of the major Earth biomes were reproduced by clustering grid cells according to their functional identity (mean functional traits of a regional plant assemblage). These biome clusters were in fair agreement with two other global vegetation schemes: a satellite image classification and a biogeography model (kappa statistics around 0.4). Main conclusions: Our model reproduces the observed global patterns of plant diversity and vegetation physiognomy from the number and identity of simulated plant growth strategies. These plant growth strategies emerge from the first principles of climatic constraints and plant functional trade-offs. Our study makes important contributions to furthering the understanding of how climate affects patterns of plant diversity and vegetation physiognomy from a process-based rather than a phenomenological perspective.},

abstract = {Complex natural systems with eroded resilience, such as populations, ecosystems and socio-ecological systems, respond to small perturbations with abrupt, discontinuous state shifts, or critical transitions. Theory of critical transi- tions suggests that such systems exhibit fold bifurcations featuring folded response curves, tipping points and alter- nate attractors. However, there is little empirical evidence of fold bifurcations occurring in actual complex natural systems impacted by multiple stressors. Moreover, resilience of complex systems to change currently lacks clear oper- ational measures with generic application. Here, we provide empirical evidence for the occurrence of a fold bifurca- tion in an exploited fish population and introduce a generic measure of ecological resilience based on the observed fold bifurcation attributes. We analyse the multivariate development of Barents Sea cod (Gadus morhua), which is cur- rently the world's largest cod stock, over six decades (1949–2009), and identify a population state shift in 1981. By plotting a multivariate population index against a multivariate stressor index, the shift mechanism was revealed sug- gesting that the observed population shift was a nonlinear response to the combined effects of overfishing and cli- mate change. Annual resilience values were estimated based on the position of each year in relation to the fitted attractors and assumed tipping points of the fold bifurcation. By interpolating the annual resilience values, a folded stability landscape was fit, which was shaped as predicted by theory. The resilience assessment suggested that the population may be close to another tipping point. This study illustrates how a multivariate analysis, supported by theory of critical transitions and accompanied by a quantitative resilience assessment, can clarify shift mechanisms in data-rich complex natural systems.},

abstract = {Leaf thermoregulation has been documented in a handful of studies, but the generality and origins of this pattern are unclear. We suggest that leaf thermoregulation is widespread in both space and time, and originates from the optimization of leaf traits to maximize leaf carbon gain across and within variable environments. Here we use global data for leaf temperatures, traits and photosynthesis to evaluate predictions from a novel theory of thermoregulation that synthesizes energy budget and carbon economics theories. Our results reveal that variation in leaf temperatures and physiological performance are tightly linked to leaf traits and carbon economics. The theory, parameterized with global averaged leaf traits and microclimate, predicts a moderate level of leaf thermoregulation across a broad air temperature gradient. These predictions are supported by independent data for diverse taxa spanning a global air temperature range of ∼60 °C. Moreover, our theory predicts that net carbon assimilation can be maximized by means of a trade-off between leaf thermal stability and photosynthetic stability. This prediction is supported by globally distributed data for leaf thermal and photosynthetic traits. Our results demonstrate that the temperatures of plant tissues, and not just air, are vital to developing more accurate Earth system models.},

abstract = {A global classification system of natural terrestrial ecosystems (including systematic notation), based on the climate zones of Walter, is presented. The basic units of the system are the ecological units biome and biogeocoene. The zonobiomes, which are climate zones corresponding to the largest vegetation units, are subdivided into subzonobiomes and these into individual biomes. The biomes are thus natural, geographical units within the climate zones. They are in turn subdivided into individual biogeocoenes and their constituent synusiae. In addition, the coordinate concepts of pedobiome and orobiome are introduced. These are distinguished from the zonobiomes as follows: 1. the pedobiomes by extreme edaphic conditions which cause azonal vegetation. 2. the orobiomes, as mountain ranges, by their vertical climate zonation and the altitudinal belts of vegetation. These relationships are explained, and two subseries of pedo-and oro-subunits are established. Transitional zones (zono-ecotones) between individual zonobiomes are also distinguished. The classification system is summarized in a schematic, and a world map of zonobiomes and zono-ecotones is included. More details are presented in Walter (1976).},

abstract = {Abstract. New precipitation (P) datasets are released regularly, following innovations in weather forecasting models, satellite retrieval methods, and multi-source merging techniques. Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight in the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008--2017 using the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the fourth-generation reanalysis ERA5-HRES, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The regional convection-permitting climate model WRF showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics. Our findings can be used as a guide to choose the most suitable P dataset for a particular application.},

abstract = {Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

abstract = {Shifts in the timing of life history events have become an important source of information about how organisms are responding to climate change. Phenological data have generally been treated as purely temporal, with scant attention to the inherent spatial aspects of such data. However, phenological data are tied to a specific location, and considerations of sampling design, both over space and through time, can critically affect the patterns that emerge. Focusing on flowering phenology, we describe how purely spatial shifts, such as adding new study plots, or the colonization of a study plot by a new species, can masquerade as temporal shifts. Such shifts can look like responses to climate change but are not. Furthermore, the same aggregate phenological curves can be composed of individuals with either very different or very similar phenologies. We conclude with a set of recommendations to avoid ambiguities arising from the spatiotemporal duality of phenological data. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen.

Resilience has been used as a framework for understanding sustainability challenges in a range of ecosystem types, but has not been systematically applied across the range of systems specifically used for the production of food and fiber in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments.

abstract = {The identification of patterns in life-history strategies across the tree of life is essential to our prediction of population persistence, extinction, and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in plant life-history strategies is ade-quately characterized using two independent axes: the fast–slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a repro-ductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative inde-pendence of the fast–slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may comple-ment trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; to-gether these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments. life history strategy | iteroparity | generation time | matrix population model | phylogenetic signal D emographic schedules of survival, growth, and reproduction, which comprise life-history strategies, are fundamental to our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes, such as invasions and local extinctions (1–3), com-munity structure (4, 5), and species diversification (6, 7). Con-sequently, the development and careful testing of theory on how organisms allocate resources to survival, growth, and reproduction are important goals for evolutionary biology, ecology, and conser-vation biology (8). Indeed, calls for the development of a " periodic table " to classify species based on their life-history strategies and to predict population dynamics and community composition go back to the early development of evolutionary biology as a discipline (9). A main axiom of life-history theory is that trade-offs (i.e., bud-getary compromises) between different aspects of an organism's demographic schedules, such as survival, growth, and/or re-production, constrain and optimize the range of possible life-history strategies that can evolve across the tree of life (10, 11). However, the plant kingdom encompasses a vast amount of life-history variation; plant longevity, for instance, ranges from weeks to millennia (12). Many plant species' life cycles include cryptic life stages such as seedbanks (13) or dormant adults (similar to animal hibernation) (14). Reproduction also can be highly vari-able among plants, with seed mass and per-capita seed pro-duction ranging across six orders of magnitude (15). Previous classifications of plant life-history strategies have been limited in geographic (16, 17), taxonomic, and phylogenetic scales (17) and in the ability to differentiate life-history trade-offs (17–19). Here we propose an approach analogous to that developed decades ago for vertebrates (20) to study the drivers behind plant life-history variation. We combine demographic, phylogenetic, and ecological data from natural populations of 418 plant species worldwide (Fig. 1) to address the following questions: (i) What are the main axes of variation of plant life-history strategies? (ii) To what extent do phylogenetic ancestry, habitat, growth form, and size constrain plant life-history variation? We then test whether the position of a species on these axes predicts two important metrics of population performance: population growth rate and speed of recovery from disturbances. If clear patterns emerge, they may form the basis for a satisfactory classification and predictive},

abstract = {Most spiders use venom to paralyze their prey and are commonly feared for their potential to cause injury to humans. In North America, one species in particular, Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider, Sicariidae), causes the majority of necrotic wounds induced by the Araneae. However, its distributional limitations are poorly understood and, as a result, medical professionals routinely misdiagnose brown recluse bites outside endemic areas, confusing putative spider bites for other serious conditions. To address the issue of brown recluse distribution, we employ ecological niche modeling to investigate the present and future distributional potential of this species. We delineate range boundaries and demonstrate that under future climate change scenarios, the spider's distribution may expand northward, invading previously unaffected regions of the USA. At present, the spider's range is centered in the USA, from Kansas east to Kentucky and from southern Iowa south to Louisiana. Newly influenced areas may include parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These results illustrate a potential negative consequence of climate change on humans and will aid medical professionals in proper bite identification/treatment, potentially reducing bite misdiagnoses.},

abstract = {After a period of heavy emphasis on negative interactions, such as predation and competition, the past two decades have seen an explosion of literature on the role of positive interactions in ecological communities. Such positive interactions can take many forms. One possibility is that amelioration of environmental stress by plants or sessile animals enhances growth, reproduction and survival of others, but many more intricate patterns exist. Importantly such positive interactions may contribute to creating a positive feedback. For instance biomass can lead to improved environmental conditions causing better growth and therefore leading to more biomass. A positive feedback is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the emergence of alternative stable states at the community scale. However, the literature on positive interactions in plant and animal communities rarely addresses this connection. Here, we address this gap, asking the question of when positive interactions may lead to alternative stable states, and hence set the stage for catastrophic transitions at tipping points in ecosystems. We argue that, although there are a number of now classical examples in the literature for which positive interactions are clearly the main actors of positive feedback loops, more empirical and theoretical research scaling up from the individual-level interactions to the community and the ecosystem scale processes is needed to further understand under which conditions positive interactions can trigger positive feedback loops, and thereby alternative stable states.},

abstract = {An important goal of conservation biology is the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations. The approaches presented here illustrate feasible ways to incorporate the ecosystem functioning dimension into conservation through the use of satellite-derived information. 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We describe a spatially explicit simulation experiment designed to assess relative impacts of macroecological traits on patterns of biological diversification under changing environmental conditions. Using a simulation framework, we assessed impacts of species' niche breadth (i.e., the range of their abiotic tolerances) and dispersal ability on resulting patterns of speciation and extinction and evaluated how these traits, in conjunction with environmental change, shape biological diversification. Simulation results supported both niche breadth and dispersal ability as important drivers of diversification in the face of environmental change, and suggested that the rate of environmental change influences how species interact with the extrinsic environment to generate diversity. Niche breadth had greater effects on speciation and extinction than dispersal ability when climate changed rapidly, whereas dispersal ability effects were elevated when climate changed slowly. Our simulations provide a bottom-up perspective on the generation and maintenance of diversity under climate change, offering a better understanding of potential interactions between species' intrinsic macroecological characteristics and a dynamic extrinsic environment in the process of biological diversification.},

abstract = {* Schedules of survival, growth and reproduction are key life-history traits. Data on how these traits vary among species and populations are fundamental to our understanding of the ecological conditions that have shaped plant evolution. Because these demographic schedules determine population growth or decline, such data help us understand how different biomes shape plant ecology, how plant populations and communities respond to global change and how to develop successful management tools for endangered or invasive species. * Matrix population models summarize the life cycle components of survival, growth and reproduction, while explicitly acknowledging heterogeneity among classes of individuals in the population. Matrix models have comparable structures, and their emergent measures of population dynamics, such as population growth rate or mean life expectancy, have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among populations and species. * Thousands of plant matrix population models have been parameterized from empirical data, but they are largely dispersed through peer-reviewed and grey literature, and thus remain inaccessible for synthetic analysis. Here, we introduce the compadre Plant Matrix Database version 3.0, an open-source online repository containing 468 studies from 598 species world-wide (672 species hits, when accounting for species studied in more than one source), with a total of 5621 matrices. compadre also contains relevant ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, growth form, taxonomy, phylogeny) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from the matrices. * Synthesis. Large collections of data allow broad questions to be addressed at the global scale, for example, in genetics (genbank), functional plant ecology (try, bien, d3) and grassland community ecology (nutnet). Here, we present compadre, a similarly data-rich and ecologically relevant resource for plant demography. Open access to this information, its frequent updates and its integration with other online resources will allow researchers to address timely and important ecological and evolutionary questions.},

abstract = {1. Alternate stable states (ASS) theory is a dominant conceptual framework for understanding processes that support resilience of ecological communities in the face of multiple anthropogenic disturbances. For decades, coral reefs have been cited as a classic example of ASS, yet this position remains highly controversial, largely because convincing empirical evaluations have been elusive.2.Using a combination of empirical measurements of positive feedback processes and simulation modeling, we assessed ASS in coral reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) by identifying the potential for multiple basins of attraction from a mechanistic perspective. 3.Using bioassays of algal growth and consumption we quantified two spatially-localised positive feedback mechanisms on coral reefs: increasing herbivore activity associated with higher coral abundances and amelioration of nutrient limitation leading to higher algal growth in areas with higher algal abundance. 4. Analysis of a model of benthic community dynamics incorporating these feedbacks showed they were central to producing hysteresis and bistability in the model, two hallmarks of ASS. Further, reefs simulated with conditions matching those measured at Isla Contadora, Panam{\'{a}} displayed ASS dynamics while producing spatial patterns matching field observations. This provides model-derived support, based on empirically measured conditions of ETP reefs, for the presence of ASS. 5. Synthesis. The combination of experimental bioassays to measure feedback strengths and simulation models to evaluate the influence of those feedbacks provides a novel, non-destructive approach to evaluating ASS dynamics that can be applied in threatened ecosystems where classic approaches are not viable.},

abstract = {Cropp and Gabric [Ecosystem adaptation: do ecosystems maximise resilience? Ecology. In press] used a simple phytoplankton-zooplankton-nutrient model and a genetic algorithm to determine the parameter values that would maximize the value of certain goal functions. These goal functions were to maximize biomass, maximize flux, maximize flux to biomass ratio, and maximize resilience. It was found that maximizing goal functions maximized resilience. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the Cropp and Gabric [Ecosystem adaptation: do ecosystems maximise resilience? Ecology. In press] result was indicative of a general ecosystem principle, or peculiar to the model and parameter ranges used. This study successfully replicated the Cropp and Gabric [Ecosystem adaptation: do ecosystems maximise resilience? Ecology. In press] experiment for a number of different model types, however, a different interpretation of the results is made. A new metric, concordance, was devised to describe the agreement between goal functions. It was found that resilience has the highest concordance of all goal functions trialled, for most model types. This implies that resilience offers a compromise between the established ecological goal functions. The parameter value range used is found to affect the parameter versus goal function relationships. Local maxima and minima affected the relationship between parameters and goal functions, and between goal functions. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Ecological responses to environmental change are therefore difficult to predict, and entail large degrees of uncertainty. Such uncertainty requires robust tools for management to sustain ecosystem goods and services and maintain resilient ecosystems. 2. We propose an approach based on discontinuity theory that accounts for patterns and processes at distinct spatial and temporal scales, an inherent property of ecological systems. Discontinuity theory has not been applied in natural resource management and could there-fore improve ecosystem management because it explicitly accounts for ecological complexity. 3. Synthesis and applications. We highlight the application of discontinuity approaches for meeting management goals. Specifically, discontinuity approaches have significant potential to measure and thus understand the resilience of ecosystems, to objectively identify critical scales of space and time in ecological systems at which human impact might be most severe, to pro-vide warning indicators of regime change, to help predict and understand biological invasions and extinctions and to focus monitoring efforts. Discontinuity theory can complement current approaches, providing a broader paradigm for ecological management and conservation.},

Here, we evaluate spatial patterns of climate and vegetation across a grassland-forest biome boundary to examine evidence in favour of either of these alternatives.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nLocationMinnesota, USA.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethodsVegetation data represented the presence of prairie vs. forest vegetation in Minnesota from 1847 to 1908, generally prior to European settlement of the region, while the climatic variables represented an index of long-term average moisture availability (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P - PET). Using linear and sigmoidal regression models, we evaluated spatial patterns of change in vegetation, climate and vegetation-climate relationships across 22 transects (170-400km) oriented perpendicular to the biome boundary. We also evaluated boundary characteristics in light of dominant topographical controls and position along the boundary.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResultsVegetation followed a sigmoidal pattern of change across the boundary, with mean boundary width of ca. 100km. The P - PET increased by ca. 100mm across the boundary following a comparatively smooth pattern of change. Climate-vegetation relationships were clearly non-linear across the boundary, indicating these variables did not change in a common spatial pattern. Regional topographical controls modified relationships between vegetation and climate along the length of the boundary.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusionsOur results document strong non-linear relationships between the presence of forest vegetation and its dominant climate control across a grassland-forest biome boundary. An average change of ca. 100mm in P - PET moving across the boundary is about 40{\%} of the long-term mean annual range of this variable, suggesting that modest changes to P - PET may potentially cause substantial shifts in the location of the prairie-forest boundary.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the primary antibody responsible for mucosal defense in mammals and has been used as a marker for chronic stress and immune status. Therefore, this antibody may provide a more reliable indicator of an individual's immunocompetence than is currently available through other methods. Immunoglobulin A has never before been quantified in a wild population of non-human primates using non-invasive sample collection techniques. In this study, we present methodology for non-invasive IgA extraction in the field and provide quantification of mean fecal IgA concentrations in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). During the study period (November 2009-October 2010), we collected fecal samples (N=1463) from 59 individuals at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We modified a field extraction technique for steroidal hormones to extract IgA from the fecal samples and then quantified mean IgA concentrations (ng/g) using a commercial human IgA enzyme immunoassay. Mean IgA concentration varied among individuals but not by sex or reproductive status. Mature animals tended toward higher mean IgA concentration than immature. Mean IgA concentration differed by quartile season, following a similar pattern previously observed for respiratory illness rates in this population, with the late dry season having significantly higher averages than the late wet. A circadian rhythm was also evident with mean IgA concentrations higher in samples collected in the latter half of the day. These demographic and temporal patterns of IgA concentration provide baseline values necessary to interpret future results, which may be combined with other health values to better understand the role of health and long-term stress in wild great ape populations.},

abstract = {Ecological systems with asymptotically stable equilibria may exhibit significant transient dynamics following perturbations. In some cases, these transient dynamics include the possibility of excursions away from the equilibrium before the eventual return; systems that exhibit such amplification of perturbations are called reactive. Reactivity is a common property of ecological systems, and the amplification can be large and long-lasting. The transient response of a reactive ecosystem depends on the parameters of the underlying model. To investigate this dependence, we develop sensitivity analyses for indices of transient dynamics (reactivity, the amplification envelope, and the optimal perturbation) in both continuous- and discrete-time models written in matrix form. The sensitivity calculations require expressions, some of them new, for the derivatives of equilibria, eigenvalues, singular values, and singular vectors, obtained using matrix calculus. Sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative framework for investigating the mechanisms leading to transient growth. We apply the methodology to a predator-prey model and a size-structured food web model. The results suggest predator-driven and prey-driven mechanisms for transient amplification resulting from multispecies interactions.},

Although a thin continuous marginal parenchyma band represents the limit of seasonal xylem production, and in spite of the presence of false rings, cross-dating is possible. In this sense, an interseries correlation of 0.572 was found indicating a considerable degree of consistency in the variability found among trees. Precipitation between January and July has a direct influence on growth, while a five month dry season interrupts the active division of cambial cells. A significant positive correlation was also found between sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic and tree growth, but with a lag of six months. As the rainfall regime of northeastern Brazil presents a great deal of inter-annual variability due to fluctuations in global factors such as the SSTs of the tropical Atlantic and the intertropical convergence zone, the close relationship observed between P. pyramidalis tree growth and regional climate fluctuations appears as a logical plant-environment interaction that can be used as a reliable parameter for dendroecological inferences on tree growth dynamics and the reconstructions of past droughts in the Caatinga region.},

abstract = {Many introductory ecology textbooks illustrate succession, at least in part, by using certain classic studies (e.g. sand dunes, ponds/bogs, glacial till, and old fields) that substituted space for time (chronosequence) in determining the sequences of the succession. Despite past criticisms of this method, there is continued, often uncritical, use of chronosequences in current research on topics besides succession, including temporal changes in biodiversity, productivity, nutrient cycling, etc. To show the problem with chronosequence-based studies in general, we review evidence from studies that used non-chronosequence methods (such as long-term study of permanent plots, palynology, and stand reconstruction) to test the space-for-time substitution in four classic succession studies. In several cases, the tests have used the same locations and, in one case, the same plots as those in the original studies. We show that empirical evidence invalidates the chronosequence-based sequences inferred in these classic studies.},

The AVHRR instruments have flown or are flying on fourteen polar-orbiting meteorological satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and are currently flying on two European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, MetOp-A and MetOp-B. This long AVHRR record is comprised of data from two different sensors: the AVHRR/2 instrument that spans July 1981 to November 2000 and the AVHRR/3 instrument that continues these measurements from November 2000 to the present. The main difficulty in processing AVHRR NDVI data is to properly deal with limitations of the AVHRR instruments. Complicating among-instrument AVHRR inter-calibration of channels one and two is the dual gain introduced in late 2000 on the AVHRR/3 instruments for both these channels. We have processed NDVI data derived from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1997 to 2010 to overcome among-instrument AVHRR calibration difficulties. We use Bayesian methods with high quality well-calibrated SeaWiFS NDVI data for deriving AVHRR NDVI calibration parameters. Evaluation of the uncertainties of our resulting NDVI values gives an error of ± 0.005 NDVI units for our 1981 to present data set that is independent of time within our AVHRR NDVI continuum and has resulted in a non-stationary climate data set.},

The information proved invaluable for gathering data on the insect portion of the diet as well as for determining the period over which items were eaten.

abstract = {General principles from coexistence theory are often invoked to explain how and why mixtures of species outperform monocultures. However, the complementarity and selection effects commonly measured in biodiversity experiments do not precisely quantify the niche and relative fitness differences that govern species coexistence. Given this lack of direct correspondence, how can we know whether species-rich mixtures are stable and that the benefits of diversity will therefore persist? We develop a resource-based included-niche model in which plant species have asymmetric access to a nested set of belowground resource pools. We use the model to show that positive complementarity effects arise from stabilising niche differences, but do not necessarily lead to stable coexistence and hence can be transient. In addition, these transient complementarity effects occur in the model when there is no complementary resource use among species. Including a trade-off between uptake rates and the size of the resource pool stabilised interactions and led to persistent complementarity coupled with weak or negative selection effects, consistent with results from the longest-running field biodiversity experiments. We suggest that future progress requires a greater mechanistic understanding of the links between ecosystem functions and their underlying biological processes.},

abstract = {*$\backslash$nThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nEvidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nThere are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. are common intestinal protozoan parasites in domestic cats. Few studies have critically evaluated the performance characteristics of commercially available immunoassays for detection of these organisms in the cat. HYPOTHESIS: Human-based immunoassays are suboptimal for the detection of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. in cats. ANIMALS: Three-hundred-and-forty-four cats with diarrheic and nondiarrheic fecal specimens at 4 northern California animal shelters. METHODS: A fecal specimen was collected from each cat in a case-controlled fashion. Fecal specimens were tested for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. by using centrifugation flotation and 5 commercially available immunoassays (SNAP Giardia, ProSpecT Giardia Microplate Assay, ProSpecT Cryptosporidium Microplate Assay, ImmunoCard STAT! Cryptosporidium/ Giardia Rapid Assay, and Xpect Giardia/Cryptosporidium). Results were compared with a reference standard, the MeriFluor direct immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Overall prevalences of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were 9.8 and 4.7{\%}, respectively. The ProSpecT Microplate Assay had the highest sensitivities and specificities for Giardia spp. (91.2 and 99.4{\%}) and Cryptosporidum spp. (71.4 and 96.7{\%}), respectively. The SNAP Giardia antigen assay was easier to use and equally sensitive (85.3{\%}) and specific (100{\%}) to fecal flotation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Caution should be exercised when using human-based immunoassays for the diagnosis of Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. in cats. Fecal flotation remains a useful method for detection of Giardia spp., can be used to detect other parasites, and has a sensitivity of 97.8{\%} for detection of Giardia spp. when combined with the SNAP Giardia immunoassay.},

abstract = {Resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a socioecological system (SES) moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes. Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the domain of attraction or the frequency of events that could push the system across the boundaries. Examples are soil phosphorus content in lake districts woody vegetation cover in rangelands, and property rights systems that affect land use in both lake districts and rangelands. (b) The ability of an SES to self-organize is related to the extent to which reorganization is endogenous rather than forced by external drivers. Self-organization is enhanced by coevolved ecosystem components and the presence of social networks that facilitate innovative problem solving. (c) The adaptive capacity of an SES is related to the existence of mechanisms for the evolution of novelty or learning. Examples include biodiversity at multiple scales and the existence of institutions that facilitate experimentation, discovery, and innovation.},

abstract = {The land surface phenology (LSP) start of season (SOS) metric signals the seasonal onset of vegetation activity, including canopy growth and associated increases in land-atmosphere water, energy and carbon (CO2) exchanges influencing weather and climate variability. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter determined from satellite passive microwave remote sensing provides for global LSP monitoring that is sensitive to changes in vegetation canopy water content and biomass, and insensitive to atmosphere and solar illumination constraints. Direct field measures of canopy water content and biomass changes desired for LSP validation are generally lacking due to the prohibitive costs of maintaining regional monitoring networks. Alternatively, a normalized microwave reflectance index (NMRI) derived from GPS base station measurements is sensitive to daily vegetation water content changes and may provide for effective microwave LSP validation. We compared multiyear (2007-2011) NMRI and satellite VOD records at over 300 GPS sites in North America, and their derived SOS metrics for a subset of 24 homogenous land cover sites to investigate VOD and NMRI correspondence, and potential NMRI utility for LSP validation. Significant correlations (P {\textless} 0.05) were found at 276 of 305 sites (90.5 {\%}), with generally favorable correspondence in the resulting SOS metrics (r (2) = 0.73, P {\textless} 0.001, RMSE = 36.8 days). This study is the first attempt to compare satellite microwave LSP metrics to a GPS network derived reflectance index and highlights both the utility and limitations of the NMRI data for LSP validation, including spatial scale discrepancies between local NMRI measurements and relatively coarse satellite VOD retrievals.},

abstract = {Land cover plays a key role in global to regional monitoring and modeling because it affects and is being affected by climate change and thus became one of the essential variables for climate change studies. National and international organizations require timely and accurate land cover information for reporting and management actions. The North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) is an international cooperation of organizations and entities of Canada, the United States, and Mexico to map land cover change of North America's changing environment. This paper presents the methodology to derive the land cover map of Mexico for the year 2005 which was integrated in the NALCMS continental map. Based on a time series of 250. m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and an extensive sample data base the complexity of the Mexican landscape required a specific approach to reflect land cover heterogeneity. To estimate the proportion of each land cover class for every pixel several decision tree classifications were combined to obtain class membership maps which were finally converted to a discrete map accompanied by a confidence estimate. The map yielded an overall accuracy of 82.5{\%} (Kappa of 0.79) for pixels with at least 50{\%} map confidence (71.3{\%} of the data). An additional assessment with 780 randomly stratified samples and primary and alternative calls in the reference data to account for ambiguity indicated 83.4{\%} overall accuracy (Kappa of 0.80). A high agreement of 83.6{\%} for all pixels and 92.6{\%} for pixels with a map confidence of more than 50{\%} was found for the comparison between the land cover maps of 2005 and 2006. Further wall-to-wall comparisons to related land cover maps resulted in 56.6{\%} agreement with the MODIS land cover product and a congruence of 49.5 with Globcover. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Over the last 43 years, a huge theoretical and empirical literature has developed on this topic. However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research. Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular, we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism, mutual benefit, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection and direct fitness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations of behaviours.

Historical and environmental differences drive the regional variation in the functional relationships between woody vegetation, fire, and climate.

abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY To respond to the needs of decision makers to plan for climate change, a variety of reports, tools, and datasets provide projected climate impacts at spatial and temporal scales much finer than those at which the projections are made. It is important to recognize the variety of assumptions behind the techniques used to derive such information and the limitations they impose on the results. The main tools used to project climate are General Circulation Model (GCMs), which are computer models that mathematically represent various physical processes of the global climate system. These processes are generally well known but often cannot be fully represented in the models due to limitations on computing resources and input data. Thus, GCM results should only be considered at global or continental scales for climatic conditions averaged at monthly, seasonal, annual, and longer time scales. Any information that is presented at spatial scales finer than 100 kilometers x 100 kilometers and temporal scales finer than monthly values has undergone a process called downscaling. While it produces climatic information at scales finer than the initial projections, this process involves additional information, data, and assumptions, leading to further uncertainties and limitations of the results, a consequence that is often not made explicit to end-users. International organizations or national governments currently provide no official guidance that assists researchers, practitioners, and decision makers in determining climate projection parameters, downscaling methods, and data sources that best meet their needs. Since the research community is still developing downscaling methods, users often need to read highly technical and specialized explanations in order to understand and adequately apply the results for impact studies, planning, or decision-making. The following are important considerations and recommendations to keep in mind when designing and interpreting fine-scale information on climate change and its impacts. FIGURE I. ILLUSTRATION OF THE COMPONENTS INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CLIMATE PROJECTIONS ? Downscaling relies on the assumption that local climate is a combination of large-scale Source: Daniels et al., 2012 climatic/atmospheric features (global, hemispheric, continental, regional) and local conditions (topography, water bodies, land surface properties). Representation of the latter is generally beyond the capacity of current GCMs. ? Deriving climate projections at local scales is a multistep process, as illustrated in Figure 1. At each step, assumptions and approximations are made. Uncertainties are inherent in projections of changes in climate and their impacts. They arise from different sources and need to be kept in mind, whether explicitly quantified or not. A Review of Downscaling Methods for Climate Change Projections viii ? Downscaling can be applied spatially and temporally. Oftentimes, several downscaling methods are combined to obtain climate change information at desired spatial and temporal scales. ? There are two principal ways to combine the information on local conditions with large-scale climate projections: - Dynamical: by explicitly including additional data and physical processes in models similar to GCMs but at a much higher resolution and covering only select portions of the globe1. This method has numerous advantages but is computationally intensive and requires large volumes of data as well as a high level of expertise to implement and interpret results, often beyond the capacities of institutions in developing countries. - Statistical: by establishing statistical relationships between large-scale climate features that GCMs and local climate characteristics provide. In contrast to the dynamical method, the statistical methods are easy to implement and interpret. They require minimal computing resources but rely heavily on historical climate observations and the assumption that currently observed relationships will carry into the future. However, high quality historical records often are not available in developing countries. In most cases, a sequence of different methods is needed to obtain results at the desired resolution; however, the analysis of select reports presenting changes in climate and/or their impacts has shown the following points: ? Information on downscaling and the limitations of the results are often not appropriately highlighted, leading the user to believe that the results are “true” and valid at the resolution presented. Extensive reading of technical documentation is often needed to uncover all the steps and assumptions that led to the final results. ? Uncertainties inherent in projections and additionally arising from applied downscaling are often not presented, quantified, nor discussed, leading the user to interpret the numerical results at face value. ? Validation of downscaled results (on historical data) is often omitted; comparing downscaled results to high-resolution observed information would highlight systematic biases and the limitations of results. The above deficiencies most frequently result from simple oversight by the authors of the report or their efforts to make it easy to use. However, they are important, and an expert user may be able to detect them and estimate the limitations of the results. The overall diversity of the approaches and methods in existing reports and publications reflects the diversity of the goals and resources of each assessment. Thus, there is no single best downscaling approach, and downscaling methods will depend on the desired spatial and temporal resolution of outputs and the climate characteristics of the highest impact of interest. In light of current approaches and practices reviewed in this report, it is possible to make the recommendations that follow. 1 Since the main constraint on resolution is the available computing resource, increasing the resolution requires reducing the area covered; therefore, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) usually cover portions of the globe. A Review of Downscaling Methods for Climate Change Projections ix RECOMMENDATIONS ? Given the diversity of developed approaches, it is best to partner with a climate scientist or downscaling expert who can help to evaluate the needs, relevant techniques, and limitations of the results, as detailed below. ? When designing assessments of climate change and its impacts at sub-regional scales, a thorough evaluation of the information needs and the relevance of existing information should be carried out first. If the need for an original downscaling of the projections is confirmed, the approach should be selected based on the information needs and also, importantly, on available resources (data, computing resources, expertise, and time-frames). The decision tree (Figure 2) has been designed to guide the sponsors and the scientists in determining an appropriate downscaling method. The questions are important considerations that should be answered carefully. It is important to note that this decision tree is not customized to a particular assessment or project, and thus some questions that are essential to a particular case may be missing. ? When using/interpreting existing results/reports, the coarse resolution of the initial projections and the scales at which they are valid need to be kept in mind. Any results presenting fine-scale spatial details or using high temporal resolution data have undergone a manipulation (usually a sequence of manipulations) of the original projections, whether this process is described or not. It is only through an evaluation of the employed downscaling procedure that the validity of the results at a fine resolution and the value added over initial coarse projections can be assessed. Results that look detailed may actually not be robust; in general, a rigorous downscaling process requires including additional information, and a simple interpolation from coarse- to fine-scale may not lead to reliable results. Therefore, it is important to understand (and research if not directly available) at least the broad aspects of the applied downscaling. ? Since uncertainty is inherent to the projections, an estimate of it — quantitative or at least qualitative — should always be included and carried through the downscaling process. Such an estimate should at least include different potential future climate states and ideally should also estimate the influence of the downscaling procedure on the final results. A},

abstract = {Data from spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) opens the possibility to map forest vertical structure globally. We present a wall-to-wall, global map of canopy height at 1km spatial resolution, using 2005 data from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite). A challenge in the use of GLAS data for global vegetation studies is the sparse coverage of lidar shots (mean = 121 data points/degree2 for the L3C campaign). However, GLAS-derived canopy height (RH100) values were highly correlated with other, more spatially dense, ancillary variables available globally, which allowed us to model global RH100 from forest type, tree cover, elevation, and climatology maps. The difference between the model predicted RH100 and footprint level lidar-derived RH100 values showed that error increased in closed broadleaved forests such as the Amazon, underscoring the challenges in mapping tall ({\textgreater}40 m) canopies. The resulting map was validated with field measurements from 66 FLUXNET sites. The modeled RH100 versus in situ canopy height error (RMSE = 6.1 m, R2 = 0.5; or, RMSE = 4.4 m, R2 = 0.7 without 7 outliers) is conservative as it also includes measurement uncertainty and sub pixel variability within the 1km pixels. Our results were compared against a recently published canopy height map. We found our values to be in general taller and more strongly correlated with FLUXNET data. Our map reveals a global latitudinal gradient in canopy height, increasing towards the equator, as well as coarse forest disturbance patterns.},

This synthesis paper reflects on the current understanding of forest resilience and potential tipping points under environmental change and explores challenges to assessing responses using experiments, observations and models. 2. Forests are changing over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, but it is often unclear whether these changes reduce resilience or represent a tipping point. Tipping points may arise from interac-tions across scales, as processes such as climate change, land-use change, invasive species or defor-estation gradually erode resilience and increase vulnerability to extreme events. Studies covering interactions across different spatio-temporal scales are needed to further our understanding. 3. Combinations of experiments, observations and process-based models could improve our ability to project forest resilience and tipping points under global change. We discuss uncertainties in changing CO 2 concentration and quantifying tree mortality as examples. 4. Synthesis. As forests change at various scales, it is increasingly important to understand whether and how such changes lead to reduced resilience and potential tipping points. Under-standing the mechanisms underlying forest resilience and tipping points would help in assessing risks to ecosystems and presents opportunities for ecosystem restoration and sustainable forest management.},

Yet to date there has been no comparative study across tropical biomes to determine rates of forest re-growth, and how they vary through space and time. Here we present results from a meta-analysis of palaeoecological records that use fossil pollen as a proxy for vegetation change over the past 20,000 years. A total of 283 forest disturbance and recovery events, reported in 71 studies, are identified across four tropical regions. Results indicate that forests in Central America and Africa generally recover faster from past disturbances than those in South America and Asia, as do forests exposed to natural large infrequent disturbances compared with post-climatic and human impacts. Results also demonstrate that increasing frequency of disturbance events at a site through time elevates recovery rates, indicating a degree of resilience in forests exposed to recurrent past disturbance.},

abstract = {The provisioning of ecosystem services to society is increasingly under pressure from global change. Changing disturbance regimes are of particular concern in this context due to their high potential impact on ecosystem structure, function and composition. Resilience-based stewardship is advocated to address these changes in ecosystem management, but its operational implementation has remained challenging. We review observed and expected changes in disturbance regimes and their potential impacts on provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services, concentrating on temperate and boreal forests. Subsequently, we focus on resilience as a powerful concept to quantify and address these changes and their impacts, and present an approach towards its operational application using established methods from disturbance ecology. We suggest using the range of variability concept – characterizing and bounding the long-term behaviour of ecosystems – to locate and delineate the basins of attraction of a system. System recovery in relation to its range of variability can be used to measure resilience of ecosystems, allowing inferences on both engineering resilience (recovery rate) and monitoring for regime shifts (directionality of recovery trajectory). It is important to consider the dynamic nature of these properties in ecosystem analysis and management decision-making, as both disturbance processes and mechanisms of resilience will be subject to changes in the future. Furthermore, because ecosystem services are at the interface between natural and human systems, the social dimension of resilience (social adaptive capacity and range of variability) requires consideration in responding to changing disturbance regimes in forests. Synthesis and applications. Based on examples from temperate and boreal forests we synthesize principles and pathways for fostering resilience to changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. We conclude that future work should focus on testing and implementing these pathways in different contexts to make ecosystem services provisioning more robust to changing disturbance regimes and advance our understanding of how to cope with change and uncertainty in ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

These come in the form of multivariate time series with different spatial and temporal resolutions. Data of this kind provide new means to further unravel the influence of climate on vegetation dynamics. However, as advocated in this article, commonly used statistical methods are often too simplistic to represent complex climate–vegetation relationships due to linearity assumptions. Therefore, as an extension of linear Granger-causality analysis, we present a novel non-linear framework consisting of several components, such as data collection from various databases, time series decomposition techniques, feature construction methods, and predictive modelling by means of random forests. Experimental results on global data sets indicate that, with this framework, it is possible to detect non-linear patterns that are much less visible with traditional Granger-causality methods. In addition, we discuss extensive experimental results that highlight the importance of considering non-linear aspects of climate–vegetation dynamics.},

Available modelling methods are diverse, but analysis usually focuses on long-term dynamics that are unable to describe the complicated short-term time series that can arise even from simple models following ecological disturbances or perturbations. Recent interest in such transient dynamics has led to diverse methodologies for their quantification in density-independent, time-invariant population projection matrix (PPM) models, but the fragmented nature of this literature has stifled the widespread analysis of transients. We review the literature on transient analyses of linear PPM models and synthesise a coherent framework. We promote the use of standardised indices, and categorise indices according to their focus on either convergence times or transient population density, and on either transient bounds or case-specific transient dynamics. We use a large database of empirical PPM models to explore relationships between indices of transient dynamics. This analysis promotes the use of population inertia as a simple, versatile and informative predictor of transient population density, but criticises the utility of established indices of convergence times. Our findings should guide further development of analyses of transient population dynamics using PPMs or other empirical modelling techniques.},

abstract = {Ecosystem management is beset with potentially confusing terminology over the use of resilience, robustness and vulnerability. Here, we distinguish these concepts, discuss their operationalization, and identify the objectives that each is suited to. Resilience is useful when ecosystems risk losing the ability to recover and requires system modelling. Vulnerability can either be quantitative, measuring the ability of a system to remain above a critical threshold, or qualitative and used to evaluate the exposure of a system to disturbance and attributes that confer adaptive capacity and sensitivity to disturbance. As such, vulnerability is well-suited to assessments of coupled social-ecological systems. Robustness measures the ability of a system to maintain itself within a narrow range of function and is ideally suited to problems that require careful setting of upper and lower bounds for system properties, such as optimal fisheries yield. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Studies of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have found broad changes in vegetation productivity in high northern latitudes in the past decades, including increases in NDVI ('greening') in tundra regions and decreases ('browning') in forest regions. The causes of these changes are not well understood but have been attributed to a variety of factors. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite data for 2000–2014 and focus on northern West Siberia—a hot spot of extensive landcover change due to rapid resource development, geomorphic change, climate change and reindeer grazing. The region is relatively little-studied in terms of vegetation productivity patterns and trends. This study examines changes between and within bioclimatic sub-zones and reveals differences between forest and treeless areas and differences in productivity even down to the tree species level. Our results show that only 18{\%} of the total northern West Siberia area had statistically significant changes in productivity, with 8.4{\%} increasing (greening) and 9.6{\%} decreasing (browning). We find spatial heterogeneity in the trends, and contrasting trends both between and within bioclimatic zones. A key finding is the identification of contrasting trends for different species within the same bioclimatic zone. Browning is most prominent in areas of denser tree coverage, and particularly in evergreen coniferous forest with dark (Picea abie, Picea obovata) or light (Pinus sylvestris) evergreen and evergreen-majority mixed forests. In contrast, low density deciduous needle-leaf forest dominated by larch (Larix sibirica), shows a significant increase in productivity, even while neighboring different species show productivity decrease. These results underscore the complexity of the patterns of variability and trends in vegetation productivity, and suggest the need for spatially and thematically detailed studies to better understand the response of different northern forest types and species to climate and environmental change.},

However, artifacts and inherent limitations can lead to misinterpretations. Across the wide range of approaches to set up such studies, we distill the main challenges associated with the imposed treatment(s), the spatial and time scale, proposing solutions and outlining the limitations in interpreting and extrapolating results. The inherent trade-offs between experimental realism (facilitating extrapolation) and control (facilitating the attribution of observed responses) resonate throughout this review. The focus on realism or control determines which issues become more important and how they should be handled. For example, covarying factors such as temperature and moisture can be explicitly separated to attribute effects more precisely but could also be left uncontrolled to increase realism. Ultimately, combining results across gradients of scale and control, including the use of “natural laboratories,” stimulates fundamental understanding, enabling more confident predictions of responses to global change.},

abstract = {A numerical process-based model of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics is described and tested. The model, Hybrid v3.0, treats the daily cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water within the biosphere and between the biosphere and the atmosphere. It combines a mass-balance approach with the capacity to predict the relative dominance of different species or generalised plant types (such as evergreen needleleaved trees, cold deciduous broadleaved trees, and C3 grasses). The growth of individual trees is simulated on an annual timestep, and the growth of a grass layer is simulated on a daily timestep. The exchange of carbon, nitrogen, and water with the atmosphere and the soil is simulated on a daily timestep (except the flux of tree litter to the soil, which occurs annually). Individual trees and the grass layer compete with each other for light, water, and nitrogen within a 'plot'. Larger and taller planes shade smaller ones; they also take up a greater proportion of the available water and nitrogen. The above-ground space in each plot is divided into 1 m deep layers for the purposes of calculating irradiance interception; horizontal variation in the plot environment is not treated. The soil is represented as a single layer, with a daily hydrological budget. Decomposition of soil organic matter is calculated using an empirical sub-model. The initial size of each tree seedling is stochastic. To predict the mean behaviour of the model for a particular boundary condition it is necessary to simulate a number of plots. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with three major requirements in mind: (i) the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles must be fully coupled in the soil-plant-atmosphere system; (ii) the internal constraints on the model's behaviour, and the driving forces for the model, must be the same as those which operate in nature (e.g., climate, nitrogen deposition, and the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and O2); and (iii) the model must be constructed so that it is capable of predicting transient as well as equilibrium responses to climate change. These conditions have largely been met by constructing the model around a set of fundamental hypotheses regarding the general constraints under which plants and soils behave, independently of any particular location or time. The model is thus potentially capable of making reliable predictions of ecosystem behaviour and structure under future, new, atmospheric conditions. The model is tested for a site in eastern North America. A quasi-equilibrium is reached after approximately 250 years with 10 plots. It is found that more plots are not necessary in order to obtain a reliable estimate of mean behaviour. Predictions of productivity, leaf area index, foliage nitrogen, soil carbon, and biomass carbon are all within the range expected for this location. Mortality is shown to be a necessary model component; without it large trees reach a maximum size, and then remain in dynamic equilibrium with the climate, without dying. The model runs at a rate of 0.176 s plot-1 year-1 on a workstation (a 500 year simulation, with 10 plots, thus takes approximately 15 min). A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the importance of the parameterisalion of phenology, photosynthesis, and foliage/fine root carbon and nitrogen partitioning for the overall carbon balance of the modelled ecosystem. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with the intention of using it to represent the terrestrial biosphere in a total earth system model. This would be achieved by linking it to models of other components of the earth system, such as the climate and the oceans, in a fully coupled manner. This total earth system model could then be used to answer a large range of questions concerning global environmental change.},

abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {The prairie-forest transition in midcontinental North America is a major physiognomic boundary, and its shifts during the Holocene are a classic example of climate-driven ecotonal dynamics. Recent work suggests asymmetrical Holocene behavior, with a relatively rapid early Holocene deforestation and more gradual reforestation later in the Holocene. This paper presents a new synthesis of the Holocene history of the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone in the north-central US and central Canada that updates prior mapping efforts and systematically assesses rates of change. Changes in percent woody cover ({\%}WC) are inferred from fossil pollen records, using the modern analog technique and surface-sediment pollen samples cross-referenced against remotely sensed observations. For contemporary pollen samples from the Great Plains, {\%}WC linearly correlates to percent arboreal pollen ({\%}AP), but regression parameters vary interregionally. At present, {\%}AP is consistently higher than {\%}WC, because of high background levels of arboreal pollen. Holocene maps of the eastern prairie-forest ecotone agree with prior maps, showing a rapid decrease in {\%}WC and eastward prairie advance between 10,000 and 8000 ka (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), a maximum eastward position of the ecotone from 7 to 6 ka, and increased {\%}WC and westward prairie retreat after 6 ka. Ecotone position is ambiguous in Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, due to a scarcity of modern analogs for early-Holocene samples with high Ulmus abundances and for samples from alluvial sediments. The northern prairie-forest ecotone was positioned in central Saskatchewan between 12 and 10 ka, stabilized from 10 to 6 ka despite decreases in {\%}WC at some sites, then moved south after 6 ka. In both east and north, ecotonal movements are consistent with a dry early Holocene and increasing moisture availability after 6 ka. Sites near the ecotone consistently show an asymmetric pattern of abrupt early Holocene deforestation ({\textless} 300 years) and gradual reforestation after 6 ka. Early Holocene decreases in {\%}WC are faster than the corresponding drops in {\%}AP, because the analog-based {\%}WC reconstructions correct for the high background levels of arboreal pollen types that blur temporal variations in {\%}AP. For example, at Elk Lake, the {\%}AP decline lasts 1000 years, whereas the {\%}WC decline occurs between adjacent pollen samples, approximately 300 years apart. Thus, early Holocene deforestation may have been even more abrupt than previously recognized. Rapid deforestation likely was promoted both by rapid climate changes around 8.2 ka and positive fire-vegetation feedbacks. Non-linear vegetational responses to hydrological variability are consistent with 1) other paleorecords showing rapid die-offs of some eastern tree species in response to aridity and 2) observations of threshold-type ecological responses to recent climate events. The 21st-century trajectory for the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone is uncertain, because climate models differ over the direction of regional precipitation trends, but future drying would be more likely to trigger threshold-type shifts in ecotone position. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

abstract = {1.Ecologists often wish to describe mathematical relationships between response variables and climate covariates in spatial models of species distribution; these relationships are commonly termed climate envelopes. There are many situations when the functional form of the envelopes should be either unimodal or monotonic, but current practice tends towards the use of either low-degree single variable spline curves fitted as part of a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) or piecewise linear forms in software such as MaxEnt. 2.We argue that such curves are often inappropriate, as they: (a) can easily produce relationships which are ecologically implausible; and (b) frequently ignore interactions between multiple climate variables in a general regression context. We propose an novel alternative parametric form for climate envelopes that appeals to ecological plausibility and can encompass realistic features of species' presence/climate relationships on several variables simultaneously. 3.The proposed plateau climate envelope function is applied via a spatial Bayesian species distribution model to data on two European tree species to demonstrate the approach. For Fagus sylvatica a complete climate envelope is estimable, but for Quercus coccifera only a partial climate envelope can be estimated as the geographical extent of the data set does not cover the full environmental niche for the species. We show that such an approach is practical, produces climate envelopes with an ecologically meaningful form, and furthermore allows the inclusion of information external to the data set being analysed. 4.We discuss the use of this new plateau climate envelope function in the context of ecological niche modelling, and argue that in some instances ecological realism should be regarded as more important than the use of formal model comparison statistics.

abstract = {Our focus here is on how vegetation management can be used to manipulate the balance of ecosystem services at a landscape scale. Across a landscape, vegetation can be maintained or restored or modified or removed and replaced to meet the changing needs of society, giving mosaics of vegetation types and 'condition classes' that can range from intact native ecosystems to highly modified systems. These various classes will produce different levels and types of ecosystem services and the challenge for natural resource management programs and land management decisions is to be able to consider the complex nature of trade-offs between a wide range of ecosystem services. We use vegetation types and their condition classes as a first approximation or surrogate to define and map the underlying ecosystems in terms of their regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services. In using vegetation as a surrogate, we believe it is important to describe natural or modified (e.g. agronomic) vegetation classes in terms of structure - which in turn is related to ecosystem function (rooting depth, nutrient recycling, carbon capture, water use, etc.). This approach enables changes in vegetation as a result of land use to be coupled with changes to surface and groundwater resources and other physical and chemical properties of soils.For Australian ecosystems an existing structural classification based on height and cover of all vegetation layers is suggested as the appropriate functional vegetation classification. This classification can be used with a framework for mapping and manipulating vegetation condition classes. These classes are based on the degree of modification to pre-existing vegetation and, in the case of biodiversity, this is the original vegetation. A landscape approach enables a user to visualise and evaluate the trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives at a spatial scale at which the delivery of ecosystem services can meaningfully be influenced and reported. Such trade-offs can be defined using a simple scoring system or, if the ecological and socio-economic data exist in sufficient detail, using process-based models.Existing Australian databases contain information that can be aggregated at the landscape and water catchment scales. The available spatial information includes socio-economic data, terrain, vegetation type and cover, soils and their hydrological properties, groundwater quantity and surface water flows. Our approach supports use of this information to design vegetation management interventions for delivery of an appropriate mix of ecosystem services across landscapes with diverse land uses. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Tropospheric ozone exercises pressure on vegetation in combination with other oxidative factors such as strong sunlight, UV-B radiation, high temperatures and water shortage. The relationship established between these factors and the plants can be either antagonistic (cross-resistance) or synergistic. Response mechanisms are activated involving physiological, chemical and morphological features. Overall sensitivity (or resistance) is determined by the amount of total oxidative pressure in relation to the plant's physiological plasticity i.e. its ability (within its own resilience potential) to alter its structure and functions in order to react to the oxidative pressure. Within different populations of the same species, functional leaf traits (leaf area and thickness, leaf mass per area or specific leaf area, tissue thickness) may vary in relation to the extent that the plant succeeds in acclimating to ambient oxidative pressure. The behaviour of a tree in an oxidative environment can be interpreted by means of leaf structure analysis. Leaves presenting high tissue density (and thus low intercellular space content) display a high degree of acclimation to stressors, react little to environmental changes and are characterized by remarkable longevity. Leaves of this type also have a high photosynthesis capacity per surface unit (due to the N content per surface unit) and a high P-N/G(W) (or water use efficiency, WUE). Thus, they are able to support detoxification processes. These morphological traits are to be found in adult plants in late successional stands and, above all, in ambients that have already been subjected to oxidative pressure. However, in early successional species and during the dynamic stages of growth (e.g. in the renewal occurring along forest edges), it is the opposite leaf traits that prevail: low leaf density, high photosynthesis capacity per dry weight unit, low WUE, low leaf longevity. These traits make plants far more reactive to environmental changes (e.g. they exploit the light from sun flecks much more effectively), but enable them to achieve only a low degree of acclimation and a poor ability to support detoxification processes. Whereas adult forests display a high level of ecological resilience and have a relatively good tolerance of ozone, the renewal stages are (at least potentially) more vulnerable. In these environments, ozone can alter the competition among genotypes and favour more resistant ones. Among the sectors most at risk, we must include communities growing at the edge of their ecological range, for whom even a slight increase in oxidative pressure can trigger substantial degenerative processes.},

abstract = {Although the boreal region is warming twice as fast as the global average, the way in which the vast boreal forests and tundras may respond is poorly understood. Using satellite data, we reveal marked alternative modes in the frequency distributions of boreal tree cover. At the northern end and at the dry continental southern extremes, treeless tundra and steppe, respectively, are the only possible states. However, over a broad intermediate temperature range, these treeless states coexist with boreal forest (∼75{\%} tree cover) and with two more open woodland states (∼20{\%} and ∼45{\%} tree cover). Intermediate tree covers (e.g., ∼10{\%}, ∼30{\%}, and ∼60{\%} tree cover) between these distinct states are relatively rare, suggesting that they may represent unstable states where the system dwells only transiently. Mechanisms for such instabilities remain to be unraveled, but our results have important implications for the anticipated response of these ecosystems to climatic change. The data reveal that boreal forest shows no gradual decline in tree cover toward its limits. Instead, our analysis suggests that it becomes less resilient in the sense that it may more easily shift into a sparse woodland or treeless state. Similarly, the relative scarcity of the intermediate ∼10{\%} tree cover suggests that tundra may shift relatively abruptly to a more abundant tree cover. If our inferences are correct, climate change may invoke massive nonlinear shifts in boreal biomes.},

For example, it is now known that thinking has two complementary modes: roughly, association versus reasoning. We systematically underestimate the role of the first, and the way our institutions, meetings, and teaching are organized heavily reflects this imbalance. By contrast, many of the greatest scientists systematically nurtured a balanced dual-thinking process. We should follow their example and reform scientific practice and education to catalyze the unusual combinations of knowledge that often turn out to have the highest impact. The idea that taking walks, reading things unrelated to your research, and hanging out with strangers in a campus pub should be considered part of the serious process of thinking, but might well meet with skepticism in practice. Should we really set time and space apart for things that distract us from our jobs? Yes we should, because many of the breakthroughs in science were made by people who were distracted.},

abstract = {Rapidly rising temperatures are expected to cause latitudinal and elevational range shifts as species track their optimal climate north and upward. However, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions. Here, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations. As rates of warming in the Arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in Arctic ecosystems is especially urgent. We established experimentally warmed and nonwarmed common garden plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic with seeds of two forb species (Oxyria digyna and Papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the Arctic. We found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment. Phenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations. Our results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.},

abstract = {Abstract Remote sensing studies indicate that slow and subtle degradation of forest canopies, or forest canopy declines, has increased in extent during recent decades, possibly due to hotter and drier droughts. However, it is difficult to collect consistent, high-quality time series of forest canopy decline occurrence observations needed for examining multi-year drought contributions to forest canopy decline at an annual scale. In this research, we leveraged a tool for visual interpretation of annual Landsat satellite imagery (TimeSync) and a hierarchical Bayesian time series modeling approach (stochastic antecedent modeling, SAM) in five forest type groups located in the western United States to assess (1) what seasonal and interannual patterns in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation preceded forest canopy decline events, (2) how drought effects on forest canopy decline events differed by forest type group, and (3) whether or not drought effects on forest canopy decline events were uniform within forest type groups. We examined observations of forest canopy decline over three decades (1985?2013) at 126 plots where we collected annual TimeSync observations. Stochastic antecedent modeling indicated that January?March VPD and July?September precipitation anomalies for the current year and 1?3 yr in the past contributed to defining drought conditions in relation to forest canopy decline dynamics. The probability of forest canopy decline decreased with summer precipitation for all forest type groups and increased with winter VPD for the warmest and the coldest forest type groups. However, the magnitude and direction of forest canopy decline sensitivity to drought varied substantially within forest type groups. The ubiquitous, but not uniform, effects of drought on forest canopy decline dynamics implied that local biotic (e.g., forest structure and composition, tree genetics) and abiotic (e.g., topography and soils) factors act to mediate effects of drought on forest change. The integration of the TimeSync satellite image interpretation tool with SAM provides a promising approach to link ecological understanding of tree drought responses to forest and landscape responses at regional and continental scales.},

abstract = {We present an inventory and analysis of discussions of ecological stability, considering 163 definitions of 70 different stability concepts. Our aim is to derive a strategy that can help to dispel the existing "confusion of tongues" on the subject of "stability" and prevent its future recurrence. The strategy consists of three questions that should be kept in mind when communicating about stability properties. These three questions should overcome the three main sources of confusion in terminology. Firstly, which stability properties are being addressed in the stability statement? Our analysis shows that the general term "stability" is so ambiguous as to be useless.It can be replaced by the stability properties "staying essentially unchanged" (constancy), "returning to the reference state (or dynamic) after a temporary disturbance" (resilience), and "persistence through time of an ecological system" (persistence). Second, to what ecological situation does the statement refer? An ecological situation is defined by a set of features that, taken as a whole, determine the domain of validity of a stability statement. The six most important features form the "ecological checklist", which serves to classify ecological situations and thereby provides a system of coordinates for communication. The six points are: variable of interest, level of description, reference state, disturbance, spatial scale and temporal scale. Thirdly, is the statement anchored in the situation in question, or is there unacceptable generalisation by inferring "stability" of the whole system from a certain stability property in a certain ecological ecological situation? This question separates the scientifically valuable content of a statement from the desire for general statements which is often projected through stability statements.},

abstract = {Through 3 broad and interconnected streams of thought, resilience thinking has influenced the science of ecology and natural resource management by generating new multidisciplinary approaches to environmental problem solving. Resilience science, adaptive management (AM), and ecological policy design (EPD) contributed to an internationally unified paradigm built around the realization that change is inevitable and that science and management must approach the world with this assumption, rather than one of stability. Resilience thinking treats actions as experiments to be learned from, rather than intellectual propositions to be defended or mistakes to be ignored. It asks what is novel and innovative and strives to capture the overall behavior of a system, rather than seeking static, precise outcomes from discrete action steps. Understanding the foundations of resilience thinking is an important building block for developing more holistic and adaptive approaches to conservation. We conducted a comprehensive review of the history of resilience thinking because resilience thinking provides a working context upon which more effective, synergistic, and systems-based conservation action can be taken in light of rapid and unpredictable change. Together, resilience science, AM, and EPD bridge the gaps between systems analysis, ecology, and resource management to provide an interdisciplinary approach to solving wicked problems.

abstract = {Leaf phenology describes the seasonal cycle of leaf functioning and is essential for understanding the interactions between the biosphere, the climate and the atmosphere. In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in Contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for 3-4 months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature.},

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase the occurrence of extreme droughts, which are associated with elevated mortality rates in tropical trees. Drought-induced mortality is thought to occur by two main mechanisms: hydraulic failure or carbon starvation. This chapter focuses on the strategies that plants use to survive these two drought-induced mortality mechanisms and how these mechanisms are distributed among the immense diversity of tropical tree species. The traits that tropical trees may use to survive drought include (1) xylem that is resistant to drought-induced cavitation, (2) high sapwood capacitance that protects xylem from critically low water potentials, (3) drought deciduousness, (4) photosynthetic stems that have the potential to assimilate carbon at greater water-use efficiency than leaves, (5) deep roots, (6) regulation of gas exchange to reduce leaf water loss or to maintain photosynthesis at low leaf water potential and (7) when all else fails, low cuticular conductance from exposed tissues during extended drought. To date, most research has focused on deciduousness, resistant xylem, soil water, gas exchange behavior and sapwood capacitance, whereas little is known about the role of photosynthetic stems or cuticular conductance during extreme extended drought, making these processes a high priority for a complete understanding of tropical tree physiology during drought.},

These patterns are similar for five dominant plant groups, coniferous trees and four angiosperm groups (grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees). These results support the hypotheses that (i) leaf N and P increase from the tropics to the cooler and drier midlatitudes because of temperature-related plant physiological stoichiometry and biogeographical gradients in soil substrate age and then plateau or decrease at high latitudes because of cold temperature effects on biogeochemistry and (ii) the N/P ratio increases with mean temperature and toward the equator, because P is a major limiting nutrient in older tropical soils and N is the major limiting nutrient in younger temperate and high-latitude soils.},

abstract = {Functional traits are morphological, biochemical, physiological, structural, phenological or behavioural characteristics of organisms that influence performance or fitness. Grouping species by functional characteristics is a long-standing idea, but there has more recently been rapid development in the application of trait-based approaches to diverse topics in ecology. Two common applications of functional traits are to characterise community responses to changes in the environment, including community assembly processes, and to quantify the influence of community shifts on ecosystem processes. Practical decisions include: What types of traits should be considered? How can traits be measured or inferred? Are traits correlated or traded-off? Which, and how many, traits should be assessed? How should trait data be analysed? Functional trait approaches enhance ecological understanding by focusing on the mechanisms that govern interactions between organisms and their environments. Measuring and understanding traits increases our understanding of ecological processes, thus also informing conservation and restoration. Key Concepts Key Concepts * Functional traits are morphological, biochemical, physiological, structural, phenological or behavioural characteristics that influence organism performance or fitness. * Traits can be broadly classified either as having an effect on ecosystem properties and the services that human societies derive from them, or as characterising a response to environmental change or with respect to processes affecting community assembly. * Common data types for traits include continuous, categorical, ordinal and binary variable formats. The data type has repercussions for subsequent data analyses. * Methods for measuring traits vary from time-consuming (hard traits) to rapid (soft traits), and in turn the information content of the resulting data also varies. * Trait syndromes describe patterns of inter-trait correlation that define differences and trade-offs in ecological strategies. * When choosing traits for calculating functional diversity it is important to consider which, and how many, traits are included, as well as what insights they will provide into the ecosystem processes, community structure or assembly processes under consideration. * Functional traits are at the forefront of efforts to develop a mechanistic understanding of how species diversity influences ecosystem functioning, and the current ecological literature presents many indices by which functional diversity can be computed.},

abstract = {Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level},

Not always clear on time scale or if changes are due to plasticity or genetics

Phenological changes in planting/harvest
- earlier blooming of cherry blossoms from 1900 onwards
- lengthening of growing season in northern europe
- advance in amphibian breeding with temp. rise
- advance in nesting by birds in UK
- 26 of 35 spp of butterflies appearing earlier in UK
- US phytoplankton has advanced in bloom
--The problem of estimating the relative roles of evolution and plasticity is tractable
with extensive, long-term ecological and genetic data. For example, genetic analysis of a population of red squirrels in the Arctic indicated that 62{\%} of the change in breeding dates occurring over a 10-year period was a result of phenotypic plasticity, and 13{\%} was a result of genetic change in the population
-Existing species appeared to shift their geographical distribu- tions as though tracking the changing climate, rather than remaining stationary and evolving new forms},

abstract = {In projecting climatic adjustments to anthropogenically elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, most global climate models fix biome distribution to current geographic conditions. Previous biome maps either remain unchanging or shift without taking into account climatic feedbacks such as radiation and temperature. We develop a model that examines the albedo-related effects of biome distribution on global temperature. The model was tested on historical biome changes since 1860 and the results fit both the observed temperature trend and order of magnitude change. The model is then used to generate an optimized future biome distribution that minimizes projected greenhouse effects on global temperature. Because of the complexity of this combinatorial search, an artificial intelligence method, the genetic algorithm, was employed. The method is to adjust biome areas subject to a constant global temperature and total surface area constraint. For regulating global temperature, oceans are found to dominate continental biomes. Algal beds are significant radiative levers as are other carbon intensive biomes including estuaries and tropical deciduous forests. To hold global temperature constant over the next 70 years this simulation requires that deserts decrease and forested areas increase. The effect of biome change on global temperature is revealed as a significant forecasting factor.},

Both the vegetation reconstruction from palaeobotanical data and the BIOME4 prediction indicate a general warmer and moister climate for the Middle Pliocene. Evergreen taiga as well as temperate forest and grassland shifted northward, resulting in much reduced tundra vegetation. Warm-temperate forests (with subtropical taxa) spread in mid and eastern Europe and tropical savannas and woodland expanded in Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts. Discrepancies which occurred between data reconstruction and model simulation can be related to: (1) poor spatial model resolution and data coverage; (2) uncertainties in delimiting biomes using climate parameters; or (3) uncertainties in model physics and/or geological boundary conditions.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMain conclusions The new global biome reconstruction combines vegetation reconstruction from palaeobotanical proxies with model simulations. It is an important contribution to the further understanding of climate and vegetation changes during the Middle Pliocene warm interval and will enhance our knowledge about how vegetation may change in the future.},

abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

In heart failure, cardiac output (supply) is decreased due to pathologic remodeling of the heart. To meet the demands of the body, the sympathetic system is activated and catecholamines stimulate $\beta$-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$-ARs) to increase contractile performance and cardiac output. Although this is beneficial in the acute phase, chronic $\beta$-ARs stimulation initiates a cascade of alterations at the cellular level, resulting in a diminished contractile performance of the heart.},

abstract = {In many cooperatively breeding vertebrates, a dominant breeding pair is assisted in offspring care by nonbreeding helpers. A leading explanation for this altruistic behavior is Hamilton's idea that helpers gain indirect fitness benefits by rearing relatives (kin selection). Many studies have shown that helpers typically provide care for relatives, but relatively few have shown that helpers provide closer kin with preferential care (kin discrimination), fueling the suggestion that kin selection only poorly accounts for the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates. We used meta-analysis to show that (i) individuals consistently discriminate between kin, and (ii) stronger discrimination occurs in species where the benefits of helping are greater. These results suggest a general role for kin selection and that the relative importance of kin selection varies across species, as predicted by Hamilton's rule.},

Residual randomization in permutation procedures (RRPP) is an appropriate means of generating empirical sampling distributions for ANOVA statistics and linear model coefficients, using ordinary or generalized least-squares estimation. This is an especially useful approach for high-dimensional (multivariate) data. 2. Here, we present an R package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for applying RRPP to linear models. Important available features include choices for OLS or GLS coefficient estimation, data or dissimilarity matrix analysis capability, choice among types I, II, or III sums of squares and cross-products, various effect size estimation methods, and an ability to perform mixed-model ANOVA. 3. The lm.rrpp function is similar to the lm function in many regards, but provides coefficient and ANOVA statistics estimates over many random permutations. The S3 generic functions commonly used with lm also work with lm.rrpp. Additionally, a pairwise function provides statistical tests for comparisons of least-squares means or slopes, among designated groups. Users have many options for varying random permutations. Compared to similar available packages and functions, RRPP is extremely fast and yields comprehensive results for downstream analyses and graphics, following model fits with lm.rrpp. 4. The RRPP package facilitates analysis of both univariate and multivariate response data, even when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations.},

Because of their important ecological and economic consequences, recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such abrupt ecological transitions. In particular, theoretical studies show that changes in spatial characteristics of the system could provide early warnings of approaching transitions. However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data. We hope that our methodology together with the computer codes will stimulate the application and testing of spatial early warning signals on real spatial data.},

abstract = {1. Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that aremeasured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. 2. Avariety of linear and nonlinearmethodswere used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in themost comprehensive data set. 3. The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits. 4. Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs when- ever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining},

abstract = {We evaluated the response of the Earth land biomes to drought by correlating a drought index with three global indicators of vegetation activity and growth: vegetation indices from satellite imagery, tree-ring growth series, and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) records. Arid and humid biomes are both affected by drought, and we suggest that the persistence of the water deficit (i.e., the drought time-scale) could be playing a key role in determining the sensitivity of land biomes to drought. We found that arid biomes respond to drought at short time-scales; that is, there is a rapid vegetation reaction as soon as water deficits below normal conditions occur. This may be due to the fact that plant species of arid regions have mechanisms allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. Humid biomes also respond to drought at short time-scales, but in this case the physiological mechanisms likely differ from those operating in arid biomes, as plants usually have a poor adaptability to water shortage. On the contrary, semiarid and subhumid biomes respond to drought at long time-scales, probably because plants are able to withstand water deficits, but they lack the rapid response of arid biomes to drought. These results are consistent among three vegetation parameters analyzed and across different land biomes, showing that the response of vegetation to drought depends on characteristic drought time-scales for each biome. Understanding the dominant time-scales at which drought most influences vegetation might help assessing the resistance and resilience of vegetation and improving our knowledge of vegetation vulnerability to climate change.},

Results:
(1) Strong seasonal signal on grassland NPPAG and NPPBG, with a shift on allocation at the beginning of the austral summer
(2) The most undisturbed site had significantly higher NPP than other grassland sites, but no differences were found when relating grazing and fire at other sites. There were lower residence times of above-ground biomass compared to below ground biomass.
(3) No significant differences on NPP between the puna and forest sites.

Conclusion
High elevation tropical grasslands can be as productive as adjacent cloud forests, but have very different carbon cycling and retention properties than cloud forests.},

abstract = {Aim Mapping the distribution and diversity of plant functional traits is critical for projecting future changes to vegetation under global change. Maps of plant functional traits, however, are scarce due very sparse global trait data matrices. A potential solution to this data limitation is to utilize the known levels of phylogenetic signal in trait data to predict missing values. Here we aim to test existing phylogenetic comparative methods for imputing missing trait data for the purpose of producing continental-scale maps of plant functional traits. Location North America and Europe. Methods Phylogenetic imputation models and trait data from one continent were used to predict the trait values for tree species on the other continent and to produce trait maps. Predicted maps of trait means, variances and functional diversity were compared with known maps to quantify the degree to which predicted trait values could estimate spatial patterns of trait distributions and diversity. Results We show that the phylogenetic signal in plant functional trait data can be used to provide robust predictions of the geographical distribution of tree functional diversity. However, predictions for traits with little phylogenetic signal, such as maximum height, are error prone. Lastly, trait imputation methods based on phylogenetic generalized least squares tended to outperform those based on phylogenetic eigenvectors. Main conclusions It is possible to predict patterns of functional diversity across continental settings with novel species assemblages for most of the traits studied for which we have no direct trait information, thereby offering an effective method for overcoming a key data limitation in global change biology, macroecology and ecosystem modelling.},

abstract = {AbstractA new drought index termed the “soil moisture drought index (SODI)” is developed to characterize droughts. The premise of the index is based on how much water is required to attain soil moisture at field capacity. SODI captures variations of precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture over time. Three widely used drought indices, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and the self-calibrated palmer drought index (sc-PDSI) are compared with SODI along with local hydrological variables such as streamflow, reservoir storage, and groundwater level for cross-validation. The result indicates that SODI reacts more evidently to relate changes in precipitation and temperature than SPI and SPEI by characterizing soil moisture over time. Results also show that SODI outperforms the existing drought indices in the sense that SODI can detect and quantify the extended severe droughts associated with climate variability and change. S...},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) remain central to the conservation of biodiversity. Classical PAs were conceived as areas that would be set aside to maintain a natural state with minimal human influence. However, global environmental change and growing cross-scale anthropogenic influences mean that PAs can no longer be thought of as ecological islands that function independently of the broader social-ecological system in which they are located. For PAs to be resilient (and to contribute to broader social-ecological resilience), they must be able to adapt to changing social and ecological conditions over time in a way that supports the long-term persistence of populations, communities, and ecosystems of conservation concern. We extend Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework to consider the long-term persistence of PAs, as a form of land use embedded in social-ecological systems, with important cross-scale feedbacks. Most notably, we highlight the cross-scale influences and feedbacks on PAs that exist from the local to the global scale, contextualizing PAs within multi-scale social-ecological functional landscapes. Such functional landscapes are integral to understand and manage individual PAs for long-term sustainability. We illustrate our conceptual contribution with three case studies that highlight cross-scale feedbacks and social-ecological interactions in the functioning of PAs and in relation to regional resilience. Our analysis suggests that while ecological, economic, and social processes are often directly relevant to PAs at finer scales, at broader scales, the dominant processes that shape and alter PA resilience are primarily social and economic.},

By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trait variability plays a fundamental role in community structure and dynamics; however, few studies have evaluated its relative importance to the overall response of communities to environmental pressures. Since fire is considered a key factor in Neotropical savannas, we investigated to what extent the functional effects of fire in a Brazilian savanna occurs via intra- or interspecific trait variability. We sampled 12 traits in communities subjected to three fire regimes in the last 12 years: annual, biennial, and protected. To evaluate fire's relative effects, we fitted a general linear mixed models with species as random and fire as fixed factors, using: (1) all species in the communities (i.e., considering intra- and interspecific variabilities); (2) 18 species common to all fire regimes (i.e., intraspecific variability only); and (3) all species with their overall average trait values (i.e., interspecific variability only). We assessed the relative role of intra- or interspecific variability by comparing the significance of each trait in the three analyses. We also compared the within and between fire variabilities with a variance component analysis. Five traits presented larger intraspecific than interspecific variability, and the main effect of fire occurred at the intraspecific level. These results confirm that it is important to consider intraspecific variability to fully understand fire-prone communities. Moreover, trait variability was larger within than among fire regimes. Thus, fire may act more as an external filter, preventing some of the species from the regional pool from colonizing the cerrado, than as an internal factor structuring the already filtered cerrado communities.},

Narrow band indices representing changes in non-chlorophyll pigment concentration and the ratio of non-chlorophyll to chlorophyll pigments proved more reliable in discriminating rust infected leaves from healthy plant tissue. Yellow rust produced the strongest response in all the calculated indices when compared to healthy leaves. No single index was capable of discriminating all three rust species from each other. However the sequential application of the Anthocyanin Reflectance Index to separate healthy, yellow and mixed stem rust/leaf rust classes followed by the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption and Reflectance Index to separate leaf and stem rust classes would provide for the required species discrimination under laboratory conditions and thus could form the basis of rust species discrimination in wheat under field conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Host-associated microbes comprise an integral part of animal digestive systems and these interactions have a long evolutionary history. It has been hypothesized that the gastrointestinal microbiome of humans and other non-human primates may have played significant roles in host evolution by facilitating a range of dietary adaptations. We have undertaken a comparative sequencing survey of the gastrointestinal microbiomes of several non-human primate species, with the goal of better understanding how these microbiomes relate to the evolution of non-human primate diversity. Here we present a comparative analysis of gastrointestinal microbial communities from three different species of Old World wild monkeys. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We analyzed fecal samples from three different wild non-human primate species (black-and-white colobus [Colubus guereza], red colobus [Piliocolobus tephrosceles], and red-tailed guenon [Cercopithecus ascanius]). Three samples from each species were subjected to small subunit rRNA tag pyrosequencing. Firmicutes comprised the vast majority of the phyla in each sample. Other phyla represented were Bacterioidetes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Lentisphaerae, Tenericutes, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacateres, and TM7. Bray-Curtis similarity analysis of these microbiomes indicated that microbial community composition within the same primate species are more similar to each other than to those of different primate species. Comparison of fecal microbiota from non-human primates with microbiota of human stool samples obtained in previous studies revealed that the gut microbiota of these primates are distinct and reflect host phylogeny. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Our analysis provides evidence that the fecal microbiomes of wild primates co-vary with their hosts, and that this is manifested in higher intraspecies similarity among wild primate species, perhaps reflecting species specificity of the microbiome in addition to dietary influences. These results contribute to the limited body of primate microbiome studies and provide a framework for comparative microbiome analysis between human and non-human primates as well as a comparative evolutionary understanding of the human microbiome.},

Instead of focus- ing on the recovery of certain species and popula- tions within disturbed sites of individual reefs, we address spatial resilience-that is, the dynamic ca- pacity of a reef matrix to reorganize and maintain ecosystem function following disturbance. The in- terplay between disturbance and ecosystem resil- ience is highlighted. We begin the identification of spatial sources of resilience in dynamic seascapes and exemplify and discuss the relation between "ecological memory" (biological legacies, mobile link species, and support areas) and functional di- versity for seascape resilience. Managing for resil- ience in dynamic seascapes not only enhances the likelihood of conserving coral reefs, it also provides insurance to society by sustaining essential ecosys- tem services.},

abstract = {Droughts and other extreme precipitation events are predicted to increase in intensity, duration, and extent, with uncertain implications for terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration. Soil wetting from above (precipitation) results in a characteristically different pattern of pore-filling than wetting from below (groundwater), with larger, well-connected pores filling before finer pore spaces, unlike groundwater rise in which capillary forces saturate the finest pores first. Here we demonstrate that pore-scale wetting patterns interact with antecedent soil moisture conditions to alter pore-scale, core-scale, and field-scale C dynamics. Drought legacy and wetting direction are perhaps more important determinants of short-term C mineralization than current soil moisture content in these soils. Our results highlight that microbial access to C is not solely limited by physical protection, but also by drought or wetting-induced shifts in hydrologic connectivity. We argue that models should treat soil moisture within a three-dimensional framework emphasizing hydrologic conduits for C and resource diffusion. The impacts of top down (precipitation) and bottom-up (groundwater rise) wetting processes on carbon sequestration are poorly understood. Here, the authors use incubation experiments to show that drought legacy and pore-scale wetting patterns are important factors controlling short-term carbon dynamics.},

However, many long-term research and monitoring programs are either ineffective or fail completely owing to poor planning and/or lack of focus. Here we propose the paradigm of adaptive monitoring, which aims to resolve many of the problems that have undermined previous attempts to establish long-term research and monitoring. This paradigm is driven by tractable questions, rigorous statistical design at the outset, a conceptual model of the ecosystem or other entity being examined and a human need to know about ecosystem change. An adaptive monitoring framework enables monitoring programs to evolve iteratively as new information emerges and research questions change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Global temperature is increasing, especially over northern lands ({\textgreater}50 N), owing to positive feedbacks1. As this increase is most pronounced in winter, temperature seasonality (ST)—conventionally defined as the difference between summer and winter temperatures—is diminishing over time2, a phenomenon that is analogous to its equatorward decline at an annual scale. The initiation, termination and performance of vegetation photosynthetic activity are tied to threshold temperatures3. Trends in the timing of these thresholds and cumulative temperatures above them may alter vegetation productivity, or modify vegetation seasonality (SV), over time. The relationship between ST and SV is critically examined here with newly improved ground and satellite data sets. The observed diminishment of ST and SV is equivalent to 4 and 7 (5 and 6) latitudinal shift equatorward during the past 30 years in the Arctic (boreal) region. Analysis of simulations from 17 state-of-the-art climate models4 indicates an additional ST diminishment equivalent to a 20 equatorward shift could occur this century. How SV will change in response to such large projected ST declines and the impact this will have on ecosystem services5 are not well understood. Hence the need for continued monitoring6 of northern lands as their seasonal temperature profiles evolve to resemble those further south},

GLO-PEM is the first attempt to model both local net and gross primary production using the production efficiency approach and is unique in that it uses satellite data to measure both absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and also the environmental variables that affect the utilization of APAT in primary production. GLO-PEM is based on physiological principles, in particular the amount of carbon fixed per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation is modelled rather than fitted using field observations.

abstract = {Plant traits – the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs – determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40{\%} of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75{\%} of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

abstract = {The ecophysiological linkage of leaf phosphorus (P) to photosynthetic capacity (A (max)) and to the A (max)-nitrogen relation remains poorly understood. To address this issue we compiled published and unpublished field data for mass-based A (max), nitrogen (N) and P (n = 517 observations) from 314 species at 42 sites in 14 countries. Data were from four biomes: arctic, cold temperate, subtropical (including Mediterranean), and tropical. We asked whether plants with low P levels have low A (max), a shallower slope of the A (max)-N relationship, and whether these patterns have a geographic signature. On average, leaf P was substantially lower in the two warmer than in the two colder biomes, with the reverse true for N:P ratios. The evidence indicates that the response of A (max) to leaf N is constrained by low leaf P. Using a full factorial model for all data, A (max) was related to leaf N, but not to leaf P on its own, with a significant leaf N x leaf P interaction indicating that the response of A (max) to N increased with increasing leaf P. This was also found in analyses using one value per species per site, or by comparing only angiosperms or only woody plants. Additionally, the slope of the A (max)-N relationship was higher in the colder arctic and temperate than warmer tropical and subtropical biomes. Sorting data into low, medium, and high leaf P groupings also showed that the A (max)-N slope increases with leaf P. These analyses support claims that in P-limited ecosystems the A (max)-N relationship may be constrained by low P, and are consistent with laboratory studies that show P-deficient plants have limited ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration, a likely mechanism for the P influence upon the A (max)-N relation.},

abstract = {The Sahara and Sahel regions of northern Africa have complex environmental histories punctuated by sudden and dramatic {\&}{\#}8220;regime shifts{\&}{\#}8221; in climate and ecological conditions. Here we review the current understanding of the causes and consequences of two environmental regime shifts in the Sahara and Sahel. The first regime shift is the sudden transition from vegetated to desert conditions in the Sahara about 5500 years ago. Geologic data show that wet environmental conditions in this region{\&}{\#}8212;giving rise to extensive vegetation, lakes, and wetlands{\&}{\#}8212;came to an abrupt end about 5500 years ago. Explanations for climatic changes in northern Africa during the Holocene have suggested that millennial-scale changes in the Earth{\&}{\#}8217;s orbit could have caused the wet conditions that prevailed in the early Holocene and the dry conditions prevalent today. However, the orbital hypothesis, by itself, does not explain the sudden regime shift 5500 years ago. Several modeling studies have proposed that strong, nonlinear feedbacks between vegetation and the atmosphere could amplify the effects of orbital variations and create two alternative stable states (or {\&}{\#}8220;regimes{\&}{\#}8221;) in the climate and ecosystems of the Sahara: a {\&}{\#}8220;green Sahara{\&}{\#}8221; and a {\&}{\#}8220;desert Sahara.{\&}{\#}8221; A recent coupled atmosphere-ocean-land model confirmed that there was a sudden shift from the {\&}{\#}8220;green Sahara{\&}{\#}8221; to the {\&}{\#}8220;desert Sahara{\&}{\#}8221; regime approximately 5500 years ago. The second regime shift is the onset of a major 30-year drought over the Sahel around 1969. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the interactions between atmosphere and vegetation act to reinforce either a {\&}{\#}8220;wet Sahel{\&}{\#}8221; or a {\&}{\#}8220;dry Sahel{\&}{\#}8221; climatic regime, which may persist for decades at a time. Recent modeling studies have indicated that the shift from a {\&}{\#}8220;wet Sahel{\&}{\#}8221; to a {\&}{\#}8220;dry Sahel{\&}{\#}8221; regime was caused by strong feedbacks between the climate and vegetation cover and may have been triggered by slow changes in either land degradation or sea-surface temperatures. Taken together, we conclude that the existence of alternative stable states (or regimes) in the climate and ecosystems of the Sahara and Sahel may be the result of strong, nonlinear interactions between vegetation and the atmosphere. Although the shifts between these regimes occur rapidly, they are made possible by slow, subtle changes in underlying environmental conditions, including slow changes in incoming solar radiation, sea-surface temperatures, or the degree of land degradation.},

abstract = {Information related to land cover is immensely important to global change science. In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature, and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75{\%} correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The dominant vegetation over much of the global land surface is not predetermined by contemporary climate, but also influenced by past environmental conditions. This confounds attempts to predict current and future biome distributions, because even a perfect model would project multiple possible biomes without knowledge of the historical vegetation state. Here we compare the distribution of tree- and grass-dominated biomes across Africa simulated using a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). We explicitly evaluate where and under what conditions multiple stable biome states are possible for current and projected future climates. Our simulation results show that multiple stable biomes states are possible for vast areas of tropical and subtropical Africa under current conditions. Widespread loss of the potential for multiple stable biomes states is projected in the 21st Century, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 . Many sites where currently both tree-dominated and grass-dominated biomes are possible become deterministically tree-dominated. Regions with multiple stable biome states are widespread and require consideration when attempting to predict future vegetation changes. Testing for behaviour characteristic of systems with multiple stable equilibria, such as hysteresis and dependence on historical conditions, and the resulting uncertainty in simulated vegetation, will lead to improved projections of global change impacts.},

abstract = {Biomes are areas of vegetation that are characterized by the same life-form. Traditional definitions of biomes have also included either geographical or climatic descriptors. This approach describes a wide range of biomes that can be correlated with characteristic climatic conditions, or climatic envelopes. The application of remote sensing technology to the frequent observation of biomes has led to a move away from the often subjective definition of biomes to one that is objective. Carefully characterized observations of life-form, by satellite, have been used to reconsider biome classification and their climatic envelopes. Five major tree biomes can be recognized by satellites based on leaf longevity and morphology: needleleaf evergreen, broadleaf evergreen, needleleaf deciduous, broadleaf cold deciduous and broadleaf drought deciduous. Observations indicate that broadleaf drought deciduous vegetation grades substantially into broadleaf evergreen vegetation. The needleleaf deciduous biome occurs in the world's coldest climates, where summer drought and therefore a drought deciduous biome are absent. Traditional biome definitions are quite static, implying no change in their life-form composition with time, within their particular climatic envelopes. However, this is not the case where there has been global ingress of grasslands and croplands into forested vegetation. The global spread of grasses, a new super-biome, was probably initiated 30-45 Myr ago by an increase in global aridity, and was driven by the natural spread of the disturbances of fire and animal grazing. These disturbances have been further extended over the Holocene era by human activities that have increased the land areas available for domestic animal grazing and for growing crops. The current situation is that grasses now occur in most, if not all biomes, and in many areas they dominate and define the biome. Croplands are also increasing, defining a new and relatively recent component to the grassland super-biome. In the case of both grassland and croplands, various forms of disturbance, particularly frequent disturbance, lead to continued range extensions of the biomes.},

abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase the occurrence of extreme droughts, which are associated with elevated mortality rates in tropical trees. Drought-induced mortality is thought to occur by two main mechanisms: hydraulic failure or carbon starvation. This chapter focuses on the strategies that plants use to survive these two drought-induced mortality mechanisms and how these mechanisms are distributed among the immense diversity of tropical tree species. The traits that tropical trees may use to survive drought include (1) xylem that is resistant to drought-induced cavitation, (2) high sapwood capacitance that protects xylem from critically low water potentials, (3) drought deciduousness, (4) photosynthetic stems that have the potential to assimilate carbon at greater water-use efficiency than leaves, (5) deep roots, (6) regulation of gas exchange to reduce leaf water loss or to maintain photosynthesis at low leaf water potential and (7) when all else fails, low cuticular conductance from exposed tissues during extended drought. To date, most research has focused on deciduousness, resistant xylem, soil water, gas exchange behavior and sapwood capacitance, whereas little is known about the role of photosynthetic stems or cuticular conductance during extreme extended drought, making these processes a high priority for a complete understanding of tropical tree physiology during drought.},

abstract = {During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations. Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities. Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades, the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive. Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (∼8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general.},

abstract = {Shifting precipitation patterns brought on by climate change threaten to alter the future distribution of wetlands. We developed a set of models to understand the role climate plays in determining wetland formation on a landscape scale and to forecast changes in wetland distribution for the Midwestern United States. These models combined 35 climate variables with 21 geographic and anthropogenic factors thought to encapsulate other major drivers of wetland distribution for the Midwest. All models successfully recreated a majority of the variation in current wetland area within the Midwest, and showed that wetland area was significantly associated with climate, even when controlling for landscape context. Inferential (linear) models identified a consistent negative association between wetland area and isothermality. This is likely the result of regular inundation in areas where precipitation accumulates as snow, then melts faster than drainage capacity. Moisture index seasonality was identified as a key factor distinguishing between emergent and forested wetland types, where forested wetland area at the landscape scale is associated with a greater seasonal variation in water table depth. Forecasting models (neural networks) predicted an increase in potential wetland area in the coming century, with areas conducive to forested wetland formation expanding more rapidly than areas conducive to emergent wetlands. Local cluster analyses identified Iowa and Northeastern Missouri as areas of anticipated wetland expansion, indicating both a risk to crop production within the Midwest Corn Belt and an opportunity for wetland conservation, while Northern Minnesota and Michigan are potentially at risk of wetland losses under a future climate.},

abstract = {In light of daunting global sustainability challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and food security, improving our understanding of the complex dynamics of the Earth system is crucial. However, large knowledge gaps related to the effects of land management persist, in particular those human-induced changes in terrestrial ecosystems that do not result in land cover conversions. Here we review the current state of knowledge of ten common land management activities for their biogeochemical and biophysical impacts, the level of process-understanding and data availability. Our review shows that ca. one tenth of the ice free land surface is under intense human management, half under medium and one fifth under extensive management. Based on our review, we cluster these ten management activities into three groups: (1) management activities for which datasets are available, and for which a good knowledge base exists (cropland harvest and irrigation); (2) management activities for which sufficient knowledge on biogeochemical and biophysical effects exists but robust global datasets are lacking (forest harvest, tree species selection, grazing and mowing harvest, N-fertilization); and (3) land management practices with severe data gaps concomitant with an unsatisfactory level of process understanding (crop species selection, artificial wetland drainage, tillage and fire management and crop residue management, an element of crop harvest). Although we identify multiple impediments to progress, we conclude that the current status of process understanding and data availability is sufficient to advance with incorporating management in e.g. Earth System or Dynamic Vegetation models in order to provide a systematic assessment of their role in the Earth system. This review contributes to a strategic prioritization of research efforts across multiple disciplines, including land system research, ecological research and Earth system modelling.

abstract = {The role of time in ecology has a long history of investigation, but ecologists have largely restricted their attention to the influence of concurrent abiotic conditions on rates and magnitudes of important ecological processes. Recently, however, ecologists have improved their understanding of ecological processes by explicitly considering the effects of antecedent conditions. To broadly help in studying the role of time, we evaluate the length, temporal pattern, and strength of memory with respect to the influence of antecedent conditions on current ecological dynamics. We developed the stochastic antecedent modelling (SAM) framework as a flexible analytic approach for evaluating exogenous and endogenous process components of memory in a system of interest. We designed SAM to be useful in revealing novel insights promoting further study, illustrated in four examples with different degrees of complexity and varying time scales: stomatal conductance, soil respiration, ecosystem productivity, and tree growth. Models with antecedent effects explained an additional 18-28{\%} of response variation compared to models without antecedent effects. Moreover, SAM also enabled identification of potential mechanisms that underlie components of memory, thus revealing temporal properties that are not apparent from traditional treatments of ecological time-series data and facilitating new hypothesis generation and additional research.},

abstract = {1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped accord- ing to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem func- tioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assem- blages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exer- cised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental con- ditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem stability and the maintenance of optimal ecosystem functionality. Conservation measures are thus essential to safeguard the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides and human society needs. Current anthropogenic threats may lead to detrimental (and perhaps irreversible) ecosystem degradation, providing strong motivation to evaluate the response of ecological communities to various anthropogenic pressures. In particular, ecosystem functions that sustain key ecosystem services should be identified and prioritized for conservation action. Traditional diversity measures (e.g. 'species richness') may not adequately capture the aspects of biodiversity most relevant to ecosystem stability and functionality, but several new concepts may be more appropriate. These include 'response diversity', describing the variation of responses to environmental change among species of a particular community. Response diversity may also be a key determinant of ecosystem resilience in the face of anthropogenic pressures and environmental uncertainty. However, current understanding of response diversity is poor, and we see an urgent need to disentangle the conceptual strands that pervade studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our review clarifies the links between response diversity and the maintenance of ecosystem functionality by focusing on the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity and the concept of functional redundancy. We provide a conceptual model to describe how loss of response diversity may cause ecosystem degradation through decreased ecosystem resilience. We explicitly explain how response diversity contributes to functional compensation and to spatio-temporal complementarity among species, leading to long-term maintenance of ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent quantitative studies suggest that traditional diversity measures may often be uncoupled from measures (such as response diversity) that may be more effective proxies for ecosystem stability and resilience. Certain conclusions and recommendations of earlier studies using these traditional measures as indicators of ecosystem resilience thus may be suspect. We believe that functional ecology perspectives incorporating the effects and responses of diversity are essential for development of management strategies to safeguard (and restore) optimal ecosystem functionality (especially multifunctionality).

abstract = {Interactions between biodiversity loss and climate change present significant challenges for research, policy and management of ecosystems. Evidence suggests that high species diversity tends to increase plant community stability under interannual climate fluctuations and mild dry and wet events, but the overall pattern of diversity–stability relationships under climate extremes is unclear. We comprehensively review results from observational and experimental studies to assess the importance of diversity effects for ecosystem function under climate extremes. Both the broad literature review and a meta-analysis focused on the effects of extreme precipitation events on above-ground biomass reveal no significant interaction between species richness and climate extremes. Causes for variation in diversity effects under climate extremes are explored, from stress thresholds to biotic interactions and community assembly, and we consider how these may modulate the outcomes of biodiversity–stability relationships. We also examine how specific characteristics of climate extremes and timing of measurements may interact with mechanisms of diversity–stability relationships. Synthesis. Hypotheses tailored to the complexity of diversity effects, the implementation of standardised experiments and the use of trait-based biodiversity measures rather than species richness should lead to better causal understanding of whether and how biodiversity may protect ecosystems from adverse effects of climate extremes.},

@article{Gunderson2000,
abstract = {In 1973, C. S. Holling introduced the word resilience into the ecological literature as a way of helping to understand the non-linear dynamics observed in ecosystems. Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

abstract = {Aim Late Quaternary climate change can be an important determinant of large-scale species richness patterns, but it is currently unknown if its effects also extend to functional diversity (FD) and thus potentially ecosystem functioning. This study assessed whether deficits in contemporary FD, relative to expectations based on contemporary environmental regions and species richness, were associated with glacial-interglacial climate stability and accessibility from glacial refugia. Location Europe Methods Atlas data on distributions of plant species and functional trait information were used to estimate functional richness (FRich) and dispersion (FDisp) for ∼50 × 50 km grid cells across Europe. Maximum expected FD was calculated using both quantile regression and a null-model approach, with species richness and contemporary environmental regions as constraints. Then, the proportion of the potential FD present in a grid cell – the realized-to-potential FD ratio (R/P) – was estimated. Spatial autoregressive modeling with information-theoretic multi-model selection were used to estimate the explanatory importance and predictive ability of glacial-interglacial climate instability and accessibility to recolonization from glacial refugia for R/P ratios. Results Minimum and median R/P ratios were 58{\%} and 74{\%} for FRich and 82{\%} and 93{\%} for FDisp, showing that realized FD is often lower than expectations from species richness and contemporary environmental regions. FD deficits were significantly associated with glacial-interglacial Quaternary climate change (FRich-R2: 0.52; FDisp-R2: 0.41), even after accounting for contemporary climate. FRich and FDisp R/P ratios were the highest in areas with low climatic instability and close to the major glacial temperate refuge regions. Main Conclusions Realized macro-scale FD patterns appear to be in moderate disequilibrium with contemporary richness and environmental regions. Importantly, small R/P ratios are significantly associated with both historical and contemporary climate. These findings suggest that future climate change may elicit long-term functional disequilibria and thus also have long-term consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {The identification of properties that contribute to the persistence and resilience of ecosystems despite climate change constitutes a research priority of global relevance. Here we present a novel, empirical approach to assess the relative sensitivity of ecosystems to climate variability, one property of resilience that builds on theoretical modelling work recognizing that systems closer to critical thresholds respond more sensitively to external perturbations. We develop a new metric, the vegetation sensitivity index, that identifies areas sensitive to climate variability over the past 14 years. The metric uses time series data derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index, and three climatic variables that drive vegetation productivity (air temperature, water availability and cloud cover). Underlying the analysis is an autoregressive modelling approach used to identify climate drivers of vegetation productivity on monthly timescales, in addition to regions with memory effects and reduced response rates to external forcing. We find ecologically sensitive regions with amplified responses to climate variability in the Arctic tundra, parts of the boreal forest belt, the tropical rainforest, alpine regions worldwide, steppe and prairie regions of central Asia and North and South America, the Caatinga deciduous forest in eastern South America, and eastern areas of Australia. Our study provides a quantitative methodology for assessing the relative response rate of ecosystems--be they natural or with a strong anthropogenic signature--to environmental variability, which is the first step towards addressing why some regions appear to be more sensitive than others, and what impact this has on the resilience of ecosystem service provision and human well-being.},

abstract = {It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide1 . Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities2 . However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results3–13. Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50{\%} during climate events, whereas that of highdiversity communities with 16–32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25{\%}. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivitydependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability14, and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.},

abstract = {Resilience is increasingly being incorporated into environmental policy at national and global scales. Yet resilience is a contested concept, with a wide variety of definitions proposed in the scientific literature, and little consensus regarding how it should be measured. Consequently, adoption of resilience as a policy goal presents risks to biodiversity conservation, which are considered here in relation to three categories: (i) ambiguity, (ii) measurement difficulty and (iii) misuse. While policy makers might welcome the ambiguity of resilience as a concept, as it provides flexibility and opportunities to build consensus, the lack of clear definitions hinders evaluation of policy effectiveness. Policy relating to resilience is unlikely to be evidence-based, as monitoring will be difficult to implement. Vague definitions also provide scope for misuse. This is illustrated by the case of European forests, where resilience is being used as a justification to promote management interventions that will negatively affect biodiversity. To address these risks, there is a need for standard definitions and measures of resilience to be developed for use in policy. Further, there is a need for guidelines, standards and identification of best practice in relation to resilience policy, to ensure that its implementation does not contribute to biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {Human actions challenge nature in many ways. Ecological responses are ineluctably complex, demanding measures that describe them succinctly. Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall ‘stability' of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

We developed resistance-resilience metrics of plant growth to evaluate the intensity of agricultural use in a temperate irrigated basin in southern Argentina. The metrics are based on an analysis of the components of a temporal series of vegetation indices computed at a low resolution from available globally remote sensed reflectance imagery. We related the developed metrics to the properties of the soils and plant canopies observed at field scale and high-resolution imagery of the basin. Soil depth, soil erosion status and land fragmentation account for large fractions of the variance of the distribution of functional groups of the plant canopies and are also correlated with smaller scale attributes of land vegetation cover. Resistance-resilience indicators constitute a cost-efficient and adequate approach to evaluate the degree of intensification of land agricultural use.},

  abstract        = {The biological clock that generates circadian rhythms in mammals is located within the suprachiasmatic nuclei at the base of the hypothalamus. The circadian clock is entrained to the daily light/dark cycle by photic information from the retina. The retinal input to the clock is inhibited by exogenously applied serotonin agonists, perhaps mimicking an endogenous inhibitory serotonergic input to the clock arriving from the midbrain raphe. In the present study, a unique class of serotonergic compounds was tested for its ability to modulate retinal input to the circadian clock. The serotonergic ligands 8-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl)-8-azaspiro(4.5) decane-7,9-dione dihydrochloride (BMY 7378), S 15535, and 8-[2-(1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethylamino)ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione hydrochloride (MDL 73005 EF) can all be classified as mixed agonists/antagonists at type 1A serotonin receptors. Circadian wheel-running activity rhythms were monitored in Syrian hamsters maintained in constant darkness. Dim white-light pulses administered to the hamsters at circadian time 19 advanced the phase of their running rhythms by 1-2 h. Injection of BMY 7378, S 15535, and to a lesser degree MDL 73005 EF, prior to the light pulses resulted in phase advances from 5 to 6 h, and by as much as 8 h. Neither BMY 7378 nor S 15535 had any effect on light-induced phase delays in hamster activity rhythms at circadian time 14. Further, BMY 7378 is able to phase advance circadian rhythms by approximately 1 h at night even without light exposure. Finally, the effects of BMY 7378 on circadian rhythms is opposite to that observed with the prototypical serotonin 1A agonist ((plus or minus))-8-hydroxy-2-(DI-n-propyl-amino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) (8-OH-DPAT elicits non-photic phase advances in the day and inhibits photic-induced phase advances at night). These results suggest that pharmacologically blocking raphe input to the suprachiasmatic circadian clock results in substantially larger photically induced phase advances in wheel-running rhythms. This is further evidence that raphe input to the circadian clock is probably acting to dampen the clock's response to light under certain conditions. The large-magnitude phase shifts, and temporal-activity profile seen with BMY 7378 and S 15535, suggest that compounds with this unique pharmacological profile may be beneficial in the treatment of circadian phase delays recently reported to be a complication resulting from Alzheimer's disease.

The teeth shape is subject to random perturbations due to wear (a randomized Archard's wear). The consequences of shape inaccuracies are statistically expressed as a 90{\%} percentile of the STE variation, which is optimized. However, estimating a 90{\%} STE percentile by a Monte Carlo method is computationally too demanding to be included in the optimization iterations. A method is proposed where the Monte Carlo simulations are replaced by a kriging metamodel during the optimization. An originality of the method is that the noise in the empirical percentile, which is inherent to any statistical estimation, is taken into account in the kriging metamodel through an adequately sized nugget effect. The kriging approach is compared to a second method where the STE variation for an average wear profile replaces the percentile estimation.},
